<p class="centered">Izumi yawns. He rolls over to the other side of the bed. Hitsumi jumps on his stomach and wakes up him shouting in his ear</p>

**Hitsumi:** WAKE UP!

<p class="centered">Izumi coughs for air</p>

**Izumi:** WHAT THE *cough* FUCK.

<p class="centered">She jumps off and lands on the floor.</p>

**Hitsumi:** WE’RE GONNA BE LATE.

**Izumi:** For what?

**Hitsumi:** HOW DID YOU ALREADY FORGET?

**Izumi:** Damn, stop shouting.

<p class="centered">She takes a deep breath</p>

**Hitsumi:** Today’s our first day.

**Izumi:** First day of what.

<p class="centered">She gets pissed off and jumps on him again</p>

**Izumi:** AAAAGH.

**Hitsumi:** Remember now?

**Izumi:** Yes, yes I remember. Please stop.

**Hitsumi:** What is it?

**Izumi:** As a member of the Gokurengumi.

**Hitsumi:** Yes, and what does that mean?

**Izumi:** We have to go there for the welcoming ceremony.

**Hitsumi:** Good, now get up.

**Izumi:** Ahhh, but do we have tooo, it’s such a drag and so extra.

**Hitsumi:** Yes.

**Izumi:** *sighs* fine.

<p class="centered">He slowly gets up</p>

**Hitsumi:** Quick put a shirt on, we’re already late. Your jacket is on the clothes line, it’s still drying. Are you sure you need to wear it.

**Izumi:** Of course, it doesn’t matter if its wet, I’m not going anywhere without it.

**Hitsumi:** Do you have like an emotional connection to it?

**Izumi:** Not really, it just looks good. *smiles*

**Hitsumi:** *sighs* suit yourself. I'll be waiting downstairs, get ready quick.

<p class="centered">She goes out of the room and closes the door. Izumi takes a bath and puts on his white t-shirt and black pants. He goes out into the balcony and takes his jacket from the clothes line and puts it on. He looks out and thinks about his situation. He takes a deep breath.</p>

**Izumi:** *(Hopefully this decision doesn’t backfire.)*

<p class="centered">He goes downstairs and sees Hitsumi impatiently waiting for him.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Took you long enough.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at her with an uninterested face</p>

**Reina:** She’s been like that since morning.

**Izumi:** Why are you so excited? The one they want is me anyways? *laughs*

<p class="centered">The room goes silent and a sound is heard. Izumi rubs the lump on his head with a tear in his eye</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hmph.

**Reina:** *chuckles awkwardly* Don’t you think you should go a bit easier on him.

**Izumi:** Yeahhh.

<p class="centered">She quickly turns and looks at her with an angry expression</p>

**Reina:** I'm sorry, please treat him as you wish.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi smiles</p>

**Izumi:** Ehhh. (he says with a feeling of shock and betrayal)

<p class="centered">Reina mouths the words sorry to him. Izumi looks down in defeat. Hitsumi pats him on the back</p>

**Hitsumi:** Come on get up, we’re already late.

<p class="centered">He hesitantly stands up and walks towards the exit with Hitsumi following from behind to make sure he doesn’t run back to bed. As he is about to step out he remembers something</p>

**Izumi:** My katana.

**Hitsumi:** Oh.

<p class="centered">They remember what happened to it.</p>

**Reina:** Yeah, I wanted to sharpen and polish it, I thought it would be helpful, but I couldn’t find it.

**Izumi:** Uhhh. *(I should’ve kept my mouth shut)*

**Hitsumi:** *(You should’ve kept your mouth shut)*

<p class="centered">He looks toward Hitsumi. She looks at him surprised</p>

**Hitsumi:** Why are you looking at me? I don’t know what to say.

**Izumi:** Whatt?

<p class="centered">Reina comes over and grabs on his shoulder. He jumps and turns around.</p>

**Reina:** Izumi?

**Izumi:** Uhm, let’s just say its not in the best condition.

**Reina:** Oh, did you break the blade? Thats fine, I’m sure it will sell for something. *smiles*

<p class="centered">Izumi looks up in defeat</p>

**Izumi:** *(Why does this girl have to be so nice)* I don’t really know whether that’s possible?

**Reina:** What do you mean?

**Izumi:** Wellll.

<p class="centered">He looks toward Hitsumi again</p>

**Hitsumi:** *sighs* He turned it to dust.

<p class="centered">Izumi exhales</p>

**Reina:** Dust?

**Hitsumi:** Yup dust, gone, poof, with the wind.

<p class="centered">He covers her mouth</p>

**Izumi:** Alright, that’s enough, I’m sure she got the idea.

**Reina:** Oh.

<p class="centered">He turns toward her slowly expecting to get scolded</p>

**Reina:** *smiles* It's fine. It was an old sword anyways.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at her surprised</p>

**Hitsumi:** What did you expect, she likes you too much to get mad.

**Izumi:** I guess.

**Reina:** *blushes* WHAT? IT WAS REALLY AN OLD SWORD, THATS IT, BESIDES I WAS NEVER GONNA USE IT.

**Izumi:** Uh huh, thank you anyways for being understanding.

**Reina:** *calms down* Yeah, no problem.

<p class="centered">As they are about to leave she calls out to him again.</p>

**Reina:** Izumi.

**Izumi:** Yeah.

**Reina:** Do you want me to get another one?

**Izumi:** Oh that won’t be necessary. I have a better idea.

<p class="centered">-At the Gokurengumi headquarters-</p>

**Izumi:** So, only if you do me this favor, will I agree to join your squad.

**Sora:** So, unless we get you a sword, you won’t join us.

**Izumi:** That’s right. (He says confidently)

**Hitsumi:** This is your great plan? Begging?

<p class="centered">He turns around toward her.</p>

**Izumi:** Shhh. This is not begging, this is negotiating.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs* Sure.

<p class="centered">He turns back toward Sora</p>

**Izumi:** So what do you say?

**Sora:** While I am tempted to say no just to see what you will do? I’m not really in the mood.

<p class="centered">He thinks for sometime.</p>

**Sora:** Fine, have it your way. Besides, a single sword shouldn’t be too hard of a request to fulfill, considering your risking your life for the people.

<p class="centered">He turns toward Kuroya.</p>

**Sora:** Right, Tsukihara.

**Kuroya:** *exclaims* ME?!

**Sora:** Of course, you're our sword guy.

**Kuroya:** I refuse to let this guy use one of my swords.

**Sora:** It seems you misunderstand me. I'm not giving you a choice. (he says with a smile)

**Kuroya:** *looks at him angrily*.

<p class="centered">He simply smiles back at him</p>

**Kuroya:** *sighs* Fine.

**Sora:** Good.

<p class="centered">He looks at Izumi</p>

**Kuroya:** Follow me.

**Izumi:** Alright.

**Kuroya:** Keep quiet.

<p class="centered">He smiles and keeps his finger on his mouth.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Can I come too?

<p class="centered">Kuroya looks at Sora. He continues to smile.</p>

**Kuroya:** *exhales sharply* Just keep your mouth shut.

<p class="centered">She smiles and keeps her finger on her mouth too. Izumi and Hitsumi laugh together</p>

**Kuroya:** (face palms) I hate my life.

<p class="centered">They follow him to the barracks.</p>

**Izumi:** How come there’s no one here.

<p class="centered">Kuroya looks at him angrily.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh. Shhh (he keeps his finger on his mouth again.)

<p class="centered">Kuroya looks down in defeat</p>

**Kuroya:** Fine, you can talk, just don’t talk too much.

**Hitsumi:** Me?

<p class="centered">He turns towards her furiously</p>

**Kuroya:** Grrr.

**Hitsumi:** Eek.

<p class="centered">She hides behind Izumi</p>

**Kuroya:** Sure.

**Hitsumi:** Yay.

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles, Kuroya looks toward Izumi</p>

**Kuroya:** To answer your previous question, most members are out on a mission today.

**Izumi:** Oh, doesn’t Sora usually go with them.

**Kuroya:** Usually he does, but today since it's your first day he decided to stay back.

**Izumi:** How nice.

**Kuroya:** Yeah, Shion and Raiga have gone in their stead. Raiga while very… outward, is still a pretty good leader.

<p class="centered">They follow him into a room.</p>

**Kuroya:** See anything you like.

<p class="centered">The walls are filled with many kinds of weapons. Izumi walks in, while Hitsumi runs in and starts inspecting everything.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Woah.

<p class="centered">She takes a look at a great axe, a sniper, a bow, a spear and finally stops at a katana. She tries to grab it. Kuroya quickly rushes to her side and hits her fingers. She takes back her hand and starts blowing it.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Owiee. (with a tear in her eye)

**Kuroya:** Don’t touch what you’re not gonna take.

<p class="centered">Izumi takes a look around.</p>

**Kuroya:** So what have you decided on.

<p class="centered">He thinks for a while. He notices Hitsumi still looking at the katana.</p>

**Izumi:** *smiles* Fine, I'll take this.

<p class="centered">He walks over to Hitsumi</p>

**Hitsumi:** *smiles*.

<p class="centered">Kuroya looks at him with doubt</p>

**Kuroya:** You sure? You can only get one weapon from here, I’m not giving you anymore.

**Izumi:** Sure.

**Kuroya:** Fine, suit yourself.

<p class="centered">He looks toward Hitsumi</p>

**Kuroya:** It's obvious he got it for you, don’t cut yourself. This isn’t a toy, it's a weapon which can cause serious damage if you're careless.

<p class="centered">She pulls the skin under her eye and sticks her tongue out.</p>

<p class="centered">Kuroya sighs. He hands it to her. She tries to hold onto it, but as soon as Kuroya lets go of it she drops it a bit before taking it back up.</p>

**Kuroya:** It's quite heavy as well, you sure you don’t want a lighter one? (he smirks annoyingly)

<p class="centered">She snarls at him</p>

**Izumi:** It's fine you’ll get used to the weight with time. It's good to have a little weight to your sword. It will always give you time to think twice before you choose to draw it.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* Mmhmm.

<p class="centered">Kuroya gets mildly impressed by the statement but decides to remain nonchalant.</p>

**Kuroya:** Fine, if you're done here lets get a move on.

**Izumi:** What do you mean, I haven’t even gotten a sword yet.

<p class="centered">He turns toward him annoyed.</p>

**Kuroya:** Did I not tell you already. Only one weapon.

**Izumi:** *smiles* Sure, you said only one weapon from *here*.

**Kuroya:** What are you angling at?

**Izumi:** I don’t want a weapon from here.

**Kuroya:** This is all we have.

**Izumi:** Sure, ready to use maybe. I want something custom if you know what I mean.

**Kuroya:** What do you mean?

**Izumi:** Come on, you know. Those katanas in your room are works of art, they had to have been made by a master bladesmith. And seeing your interest in swords, and the smithing room back there, something tells me you're quite the bladesmith. Am I wrong?

<p class="centered">Kuroya gets annoyed by his deduction</p>

**Kuroya:** Fine, you're right. So what? I’m not crafting you a blade.

<p class="centered">He goes around him in circles</p>

**Izumi:** Do you really think you have a choice? What will your dear captain say?

<p class="centered">He attempts to mimic Soras voice.</p>

**Izumi:** Kuroya, is this how you treat our new member, I expected more from you. Or do you want to hear it from his mouth?

<p class="centered">Kuroya gets pissed and grabs him by the collar. Izumi smiles at him and he lets him down after some time.</p>

**Kuroya:** You owe me one.

**Izumi:** Of course.

<p class="centered">They follow him to the smithing room.</p>

**Kuroya:** So, what kind of sword do you want.

**Izumi:** Just a regular katana, a black tsuba and tsuka would be nice.

**Kuroya:** What about hamon?

**Izumi:** I'm fine with anything.

**Kuroya:** *thinks for sometime* anything else?

**Izumi:** Oh yeah, don’t add a habaki.

**Kuroya:** All right?

<p class="centered">He pauses for sometime.</p>

**Kuroya:** WHAT?

**Izumi:** What?

**Kuroya:** Why?

**Izumi:** No reason, I don’t like how it looks.

**Kuroya:** Are you stupid? Not having a habaki raises so many structural issues. The saya will be loose. The tsuba wont be secured properly and your blade can go flying.

**Izumi:** Don't worry about the saya. I don’t use one.

**Kuroya:** You mean to tell me that you know how to materialize and dematerialize your weapon.

**Izumi:** Yes.

**Kuroya:** *sighs* Of course you do, but still the blade will be too loose to use, it's too dangerous.

**Izumi:** Since when do you care about my safety?

**Kuroya:** *Looks at him uninterested* It's not about you, it's about the people around you. Also I refuse to make a sword that I’m not proud of.

**Izumi:** Come on, you're a professional aren't you, I’m sure you can come up with something.

**Kuroya:** I'm not a professional, that would imply this is my profession, hence I do it for money, which is not the case. I do it because this is what I’m passionate about.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi thinks for sometime and walks up to them. She looks at some of the basic blueprints of a katana.</p>

**Hitsumi:** I have an idea.

**Kuroya:** (he turns toward her uninterested) Listen, this is not something simple, I don’t have time for your nonsense.

**Hitsumi:** *(Dick head)*

**Izumi:** Come on, lets hear her out.

**Hitsumi:** Thank you. *clears her throat*

<p class="centered">Kuroya listens to her reluctantly. Hitsumi points at the blueprint, taps the area where the habaki would sit and speaks confidently:</p>

**Hitsumi:** If you put a hidden locking collar in the tsuba pocket — a thin internal ferrule that grips a recessed groove on the blade's base. It won't show like a habaki, but the groove snaps into a spring clip inside the collar and locks it in place. Keeps the blade secure without the visible collar.

<p class="centered">She nudges the drawing with her finger</p>

**Hitsumi:** So no external habaki, just a concealed lock.

<p class="centered">Both of them look at her, confused and impressed at the same time.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Did I say something wrong?

**Izumi:** *laughs* I wanted to hear what you had to say, but I didn’t actually think you’d make sense, let alone say something smart.

<p class="centered">She hits him in the head again, and he cries in the corner</p>

<p class="centered">Kuroya looks at the blueprint and visualizes her idea.</p>

**Kuroya:** *he rubs his chin* *(Hmm… if I adjust the collar tension here, and reinforce the tang groove so it doesn’t shear under stress… yeah, it could work. The lock would hold as long as the material is strong enough. It’s not traditional, but… it could work.)*

<p class="centered">He looks at Hitsumi bullying Izumi</p>

**Kuroya:** *(She’s smarter than she looks; she could be useful).* Without the habaki, the stress distribution near the base will still be weaker. If the blade takes a heavy impact, it could crack.

**Izumi:** Don't worry about that, I can reinforce it.

**Kuroya:** Like how you did back at the city center?

**Izumi:** *he laughs awkwardly*.

**Kuroya:** Fine, I’ll make it durable enough to withstand your spirit.

**Izumi:** Nice.

<p class="centered">He replays what he said in his head</p>

**Izumi:** Wait, my spirit? *(How does he know about it, but Sora doesn’t?)*

**Kuroya:** Yeah.

**Izumi:** I'm pretty good at controlling my spirit.

**Kuroya:** Why do you say it like that?

**Izumi:** What do you mean?

**Kuroya:** Usually, people say the spirit, not “my”.

**Izumi:** *(Interesting, it’s as I thought, they don’t know about the existence of spirits other than the Holy Spirit.)* I guess, yeah.

**Kuroya:** Yeah (he says suspiciously). Sora said you have a pretty good affinity with the spirit.

**Izumi:** Really, what made him think that?

**Kuroya:** You know about the other member of the Gokurensho.

**Izumi:** The absent one.

**Kuroya:** Yeah, his name is Yamikage Shousen. He specializes in the study of the Spirit. He came up with a theory, where if your affinity with the spirit is strong enough, then your spirit glows in a radiant color. This is shown as an aura around the user.

**Izumi:** I'm guessing he noticed the black aura around me.

**Kuroya:** Yeah, which led him to the conclusion that you're worth investing resources into, hence why he recruited you.

<p class="centered">He looks pissed</p>

**Kuroya:** I’d have only wished he had explained it clearly, then we wouldn’t’ve had to argue.

**Izumi:** So I assume you're in support of my recruitment.

**Kuroya:** For now, yes, and I have my suspicions about you. So, it's better to keep you closer.

**Izumi:** *smiles* Wise decision. So, how did Kuroya come up with this theory?

**Kuroya:** You’ll have to ask him yourself. As far as I know, it's from an incident that occurred.

**Izumi:** *(Let’s see)* Involving Sora?

<p class="centered">Initially, he is taken aback by the accuracy of his guess. Then he takes on a calmer face after realizing who he’s talking to</p>

**Kuroya:** Yeah, I saw it with my own eyes.

**Izumi:** *(Cyan)*

**Kuroya:** His aura was a mix of beautiful cyan and a cold azure.

**Izumi:** *smiles* *(Bingo, that confirms it. That katana has to be it)*

**Kuroya:** What’s so funny?

**Izumi:** He seems like a cyan kinda guy.

**Kuroya:** Uh-huh.

**Izumi:** So why and how did this happen?

**Kuroya:** That’s something you have to ask Sora. I don’t think it's my right to talk about it.

**Izumi:** That personal?

**Kuroya:** You could say so.

**Izumi:** *(Makes sense. An emotional outburst, which led to the awakening of his spirit)* Don't they teach you stuff about the Spirit in training?

**Izumi:** Oh.

**Kuroya:** Which leads me to another question? Who really are you?

**Izumi:**?

**Kuroya:** You say you’re from a neighboring sector. And also that you’re not related to the Gokurengumi and the Keitaigumi. Which means you’re not from O-Ten. That would lead me to believe you were born in the outskirts. So you were probably born to parents who had a low amount of blood purity, therefore you should also have the same.. Yet, without ever getting even the basic training from O-Ten, you're so strong.

<p class="centered">He paces around him, and he explains his reasoning</p>

**Izumi:** What are you implying?

**Kuroya:** Your strength doesn’t make sense. While it is nice to have a strong person on your side. When you don’t know the source of their power, it only makes you more antsy.

<p class="centered"><em>---Under Construction---</em></p>
