<p class="centered">Izumi continues to laugh psychotically as the demon and all its husks are brought to their knees</p>

**???:** HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA. How many eons has it been? The warmth of the sun, the coolness of the breeze.

<p class="centered">He looks at the demon</p>

**???:** *sniffs*

<p class="centered">He starts licking his lips</p>

**???:** And this smell, this aroma, it's just as good as I remember it.

<p class="centered">He walks up and looks the demon in the eye</p>

**???:** The smell of fear…

<p class="centered">He turns towards the demon.</p>

**???:** Tell me what you fear?

<p class="centered">The demon breaks out of his sakai out of desperation and jumps back.</p>

**Demon:** YOU USELESS HUSKS GET UP.

**???:** Fine, fine, I shall allow them to stand, it’s no fun otherwise.

<p class="centered">The husks start to slowly get up, barely managing to stand.</p>

**Demon:** ATTACK!

<p class="centered">The husks start to swarm him, but he dodges all of them and appears in front of the demon.</p>

**???:** Come on, you gotta try harder than that. You know those things can’t keep up with me.

**Demon:** (He grits his teeth, but then it turns into a smile) That’s quite a lot of talk, FOR SOMEONE WHO JUST FELL FOR MY TRAP.

<p class="centered">The husks start to dog pile on him and completely crush him underneath them</p>

**Demon:** WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW? Good luck getting out without hurting them Kurosaki.

**???:** *grins* See, that’s your mistake.

**Demon:** *shocked*

**???:** Thinking I’m the same as him.

<p class="centered">All the husks explode and fly up into the air, leading to a rain of blood. The demon slips and falls on his back, not believing his eyes. Among the blood, Izumi walks towards him with his hands in his pockets the entire time. The demon scrambles around out of fright and slowly crawls back.</p>

**Demon:** You’re not Izumi, he would never kill them. Who are you?

<p class="centered">He walks closer to him</p>

**Demon:** WHO ARE YOU?

<p class="centered">He ignores him and continues to walk towards him.</p>

**Demon:** HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

<p class="centered">He turns and tries to run away, but Izumi activates his sakai again, pinning him to the ground.</p>

**Demon:** (turning back halfway) STAY AWAY! DON’T COME CLOSER!

<p class="centered">The demon starts throwing sand in his direction in an attempt to keep him away. He leans in, his eyes gleaming with a twisted satisfaction as he watches the demon’s panic</p>

**???:** Come on, try to hit me. Don’t you wanna give it your all before you die?

**Demon:** PLEASE. I BEG YOU. LET ME LIVE. I WON’T HURT ANYONE AGAIN. I SWEAR. (he pleads as his voice cracks)

<p class="centered">He chuckles, a chilling, echoing sound that makes the demon shrink back in terror.</p>

**???:** You think I do this for others? Do you think I care how many you kill? No. The only reason I do this… is to see the fear in your eyes. To see you struggle, as you slowly lose hope. So go on, beg. Let’s hear it. All those promises, all that desperation… They won’t save you.

<p class="centered">He tilts his head, a faint, mocking smile on his lips.</p>

**Demon:** Y-YOU’RE NOT HUMAN. YOU’RE A DEMON, YOU’RE A MONSTER! (His breathing grows ragged, his voice breaking as he screams)

**???:** Me? A monster? Don’t belittle me. *laughs*

<p class="centered">He grabs him by the head and lifts him up.</p>

**???:** I’m not a monster, and I’m not Izumi.

<p class="centered">The demon grabs his hand and starts to shake his legs and squirm, in a last pitiful attempt at breaking free. Izumi brings him close to him and whispers in his ear.</p>

**???:** Now tell me what you fear?

**Demon:** y-y-y-you…

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles in amusement.</p>

**???:** That’s right, that’s how it should be.

<p class="centered">He lifts him away from himself</p>

**???:** I am…

<p class="centered">With tears running down his face, his eyes widen in horror, and his screams slowly vanish, and he lets go of his arms and lets them hang lifelessly as he realizes his fate.</p>

**Shura:** *shura…*

<p class="centered">With a vicious squeeze of his hand, Shura crushes the demon’s head, blood splattering everywhere, some drops landing on Hitsumi’s face. She sits on the sand, frozen in horror; her eyes wide and empty as she looks at him. Shura raises his head to the sky, laughing with dark abandon, his laughter echoing through the silence, a twisted declaration of his power.</p>

<p class="centered">After some time, he stops laughing and turns his gaze towards Hitsumi. She takes her hand up to protect herself by instinct. He appears in front of her as she crawls back a bit to create some distance.</p>

**Shura:** So, you’re the human he decided to bring along. *smiles* To be honest, I’m not surprised. After all, you look just like her. Your hair, your voice, your face.

<p class="centered">He says as she grabs her by her cheeks and inspects her, before letting her go.</p>

**Shura:** Let me give you some advice. Leave Izumi.

<p class="centered">Her eyes widen as she looks at him.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Why?

**Shura:** If a little bit of blood is enough to make you this scared, I don’t think this is the path you should walk. You don’t know anything about Izumi, yet you’ve left everything for him, which leads me to think you really have no idea what you’re doing. Leave him, it's for your own good.

<p class="centered">With a few drops of courage left, she musters up the strength to speak.</p>

**Hitsumi:** I know Izumi.. I know what I’m doing. I'm his partner.

**Shura:** PARTNER? Don’t make me laugh. His only partner… is *death, not his, but the death of those he loves*.

<p class="centered">He comes closer to her and smells her.</p>

**Shura:** Interesting, I don’t smell any fear on you. *smiles* But don’t get too confident yet. You don’t know a thing about him. After all, he is the one who….

**Izumi:** Alright, that’s enough.

<p class="centered">Shura's voice lowers as his eyes revert back</p>

**Shura:** Take care, Hitsumi. I hope I never see you again.

<p class="centered">His smile disappears and Izumi regains consciousness</p>

**Izumi:** *gasps for air*

<p class="centered">Hitsumi holds him up, as he almost collapses to the ground</p>

**Hitsumi:** Are you ok?

**Izumi:** Yeah. It's been a long time since I’ve done that.

**Hitsumi:** Your wounds have healed, but you still seem beat up.

**Izumi:** Ohh, are you worried about me?

**Hitsumi:** As if, if you die, I can’t get back home.

**Izumi:** *laughs* Sure.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles*.(but her smile vanishes soon) What exactly was “that”?

<p class="centered">Izumi also loses his smile and takes on a serious face</p>

**Izumi:** Are you sure you want to get into it right now? We can talk after we get to the outskirts.

**Hitsumi:** No, I wanna hear it now.

**Izumi:** *sighs* He is my…. *Weapon*, I guess. Not by choice.

**Hitsumi:** He?

**Izumi:** Yeah, he is a spirit.

**Hitsumi:** And he resides in you?

**Izumi:** In a way, yes.

**Hitsumi:** and is he always like that?

**Izumi:** Yes. I try not to use him as much as possible.

**Hitsumi:** But still, if you have control over him, then why try not to use him? He is pretty strong.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks down as he has flashes of his past</p>

**Izumi:** He is strong. But not reliable, unless im sure of his intentions, I’m not gonna use him.

**Hitsumi:** Does it have something to do with what he was about to say?

**Izumi:** Yeah... (He says slowly as he looks down with a saddened face)

<p class="centered">He keeps his hands on his head and starts to trip. Hitsumi catches him before he falls</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hey, take it easy. You’re still in pretty bad shape.

**Izumi:** I guess my body has been out of battle for too long.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi looks at him concernedly, wondering about his past</p>

**Izumi:** It's ok, I’m fine.

<p class="centered">He takes a deep breath and pushes himself away from her support. He does some stretches</p>

**Izumi:** See, completely fine.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs*

<p class="centered">He walks over to her and lifts her up</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hey, what are you doing?

**Izumi:** What do you think? We need to get to the outskirts, right?

**Hitsumi:** Are you sure you can carry me in your state?

**Izumi:** Yeah, no sweat.

<p class="centered">He carries her and starts running towards the outskirts.</p>

<p class="centered">-After a few minutes-</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hey, I see something.

**Izumi:** *exhales* Finally, we’re here.

<p class="centered">As he finishes, he slips, but manages to correct himself before he falls</p>

**Izumi:** Tsk.

**Hitsumi:** You’re still hurt. Take it slow.

**Izumi:** Relax, I’m fine.

<p class="centered">He comes to a stop right at the entrance. There is a wall, similar to the actual border but much smaller.</p>

**Izumi:** *takes a deep breath*

**Hitsumi:** Hey, look. There is a gate, let’s go and ask them to let us in.

<p class="centered">She gets off him and walks towards the gate in the middle.</p>

**Izumi:** WAIT.

<p class="centered">As she was about to knock on it, he grabbed her and pulled her back.</p>

**Guard on the other side:** Yo, did u hear something?

<p class="centered">He looks through a small hole in the massive gate.</p>

**Another guard:** You’re probably just hearing things; it’s a wasteland out there. Just wait for Mr. Akihito’s Squadron to come back.

<p class="centered">Izumi pulls her to the side of the hole and covers her mouth. The guard closes the hole and goes back.</p>

**Izumi:** What do you think you’re doing?

**Hitsumi:** Trying to get in? Why are you so scared?

**Izumi:** Shhhhh... keep it down. If they hear us, we’re done.

**Hitsumi:** (quietly) Why??

**Izumi:** We’re on the outskirts, there is usually no activity outside their walls other than the Gokurengumi

**Hitsumi:** Who are they?

**Izumi:** They’re like a group of people who go on raids to close portals that lead to hell.

**Hitsumi:** And why is it bad for us to show ourselves?

**Izumi:** When they return, their Tenguma, which are basically horses, make a noise. Only when they hear that noise do they open the gate? We go now, they’re just gonna try to kill us like those last guys.

**Hitsumi:** So, them attacking us was normal?

**Izumi:** Well, yes. But still, they should’ve responded when we tried talking to them, something is wrong here.

**Hitsumi:** So, how are we gonna get in?

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at the wall and smiles</p>

**Hitsumi:** No, no, I'm not doing this again. Besides, you’re hurt.

**Izumi:** Chill, it’s not that deep. This wall is smaller as well.

<p class="centered">He takes her in his arms again and jumps over and into a bush. It makes a decent bit of noise, which attracts the attention of one of the guards. He walks over to the bush and checks it. As he cuts it, he finds no one in there.</p>

**Guard:** I'm telling you, man, you’re just hearing shit, are you drunk or something?

**Skeptical guard:** Yo, I'm telling you I heard something.

**Guard:** Sure, you did, buddy.

<p class="centered">He scoffs and walks away from the bush. Izumi and Hitsumi grab a cloak off one of the lines in the backyard of a house and walk off behind it.</p>

**Izumi:** Damn, that was kind of close.

**Hitsumi:** Well, we’re fine now, right?

**Izumi:** Keep the cloak on and we should be good, we’re still in earthwear.

**Hitsumi:** I mean, what these guys wear isn’t too far away from us either, it's just older, like I'm in the 80s in an English movie.

**Izumi:** I mean it's still like how it used to be, so it’s nostalgic. But something feels off. The people look… sad.

**Hitsumi:** What do you mean?

**Izumi:** Look at their eyes, behind their smiles, there is sorrow.

**Hitsumi:** You're right, they seem to be taking it.

**Izumi:** But it shouldn’t be like this.

<p class="centered">He looks around with a hint of sadness. As Hitsumi is about to comfort him, a loud sound is heard, and she covers her ears.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Ahhh, what is that?

**Izumi:** That’s the Tenguma, it seems the Gokurengumi squad of this sector has come back.

<p class="centered">The loud sound alerts the guards, and they open up the gates. On the other side, tens of Tenguma arrive with carts attached to them holding gold, demon remains, and dead soldiers. The streets get flooded with people cheering them as they come back.</p>

**Hitsumi:** These guys are pretty popular.

<p class="centered">Izumi seems distracted by the cries of parents who lost their children, which were being suppressed by the resounding praise. Hitsumi looks at his face filled with sadness for the people who lost their loved ones and frowns. Among the praise, one name echoed above the rest.</p>

**Guy 1:** YOU’RE THE BEST AKIHITO!

**Girl 1:** I LOVE YOU AKIHITO!

**Girl 2:** MARRY ME AKIHITO!

**Guy 2:** MARRY ME TOO AKIHITO!

<p class="centered">The man on the first horse stands up and raises his hands, telling everyone to quiet down with a smile on his face.</p>

**Hitsumi:** So that’s the guy they’re cheering for.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks over at him.</p>

**Izumi:** He’s probably the squad captain.

<p class="centered">He looks at his hips and notices something about his sword. Before he could get a good look at it, he noticed a man run into Hitsumi amidst the chaos</p>

**Person:** I’m sorry.

<p class="centered">He apologizes and runs away.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Ouch, what’s with that guy?

**Izumi:** *smirks* That's the wrong question.

<p class="centered">She looks at him, perplexed.</p>

**Hitsumi:** What do you mean?

**Izumi:** Where’s your purse?

**Hitsumi:** (confused) What are you talking about-

<p class="centered">As she checks herself, she notices her purse is missing.</p>

**Hitsumi:** HEY, MY PURSE.

<p class="centered">She shouts at the guy, but he is long gone</p>

**Izumi:** *laughs* Chill, it’s not that deep.

**Hitsumi:** (angrily) WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HE TOOK MY PURSE? PICKPOCKET. THIEF.

**Izumi:** *holds her shoulders and pulls her back* Calm down.

<p class="centered">He hands over her purse.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Wait, how do you have it?

**Izumi:** I pickpocketed him. *Shows another purse* and got something extra.

**Hitsumi:** Is that?

**Izumi:** Yep, it's likely his or someone else’s purse.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* YEAH THAT'S WHAT YOU GET, IDIOT.

**Izumi:** *smiles* At least we have something to sustain ourselves now.

<p class="centered">Coming back to the situation, he gets a serious look and turns around to spot Akihito, but he is no longer there.</p>

**Izumi:** Tsk. *(That sword, could it have been?)*

**Hitsumi:** Hey, you, okay?

**Izumi:** What? Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* So, now what?

**Izumi:** We must head to a hotel. I’m starving.

**Hitsumi:** FINALLY, all that running built up an appetite.

**Izumi:** What is running? (sarcastically)

**Hitsumi:** *laughs* I'm joking, come on, let's go.

**Izumi:** *sighs* *smiles* fine, let’s explore.

<p class="centered"><em>To be continued...</em></p>
