<p class="centered">The next day, Izumi meets Hitsumi in class.</p>

**Izumi:** Hey, how are you?

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* I'm good, you?

**Izumi:** After yesterday, pretty good.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs*.

**Izumi:** *laughs*. How's your arm?

<p class="centered">She inspects the cut on her arm, bandaged up.</p>

**Hitsumi:** It's fine.

**Izumi:** Good.

**Hitsumi:** Did you learn for the calculus test?

**Izumi:** Yeah, wait, what test?

**Hitsumi:** You forgot about it, didn't you?

**Izumi:** Shit.

**Hitsumi:** *laughs*

**Izumi:** Well, it's fine, I'll manage.

**Hitsumi:** It won't be your first time.

<p class="centered">The teacher walks in as the bell rings and everyone stands up</p>

**Teacher:** Alright, guys, I hope you're ready.

<p class="centered">The teacher distributes the question papers.</p>

<p class="centered">He starts going through the paper.</p>

**Izumi:** This should be easy.

<p class="centered">As his pen touches the paper, he hears an explosion.</p>

<p class="centered">Screams of students flood the hallways</p>

**Izumi:** What the hell was that?

<p class="centered">All the students rush out and see that the center of the school is destroyed. The top of the school was broken as if something had crashed. The entire place was on fire. But most terrifying of all, as he looked down, he saw something he never wanted to see again.</p>

<p class="centered">Among the tons of debris, he saw......</p>

<p class="centered"><strong><em>A DEMON</em></strong>.</p>

<p class="centered">All the students started screaming as they hid behind the walls and rocks. The demon begins growling. It looks at the students.</p>

<p class="centered">Suddenly, he was holding one of them, it seemed instant. The guy started screaming, but it didn't last long. Killing him, he shouted <strong><em>"SHURAAA."</em></strong> It became silent. Izumi clenches his fist but stays back without doing anything.</p>

**Izumi:** Shit, I can't. It's not worth it. God, have mercy on his soul.

<p class="centered">The guy starts to scream louder. The demon looks at him and whispers again, <strong><em>"Shuraaa."</em></strong> The guy goes silent. The demon bites his head off. All the students start to scream louder. But they are silenced by the roars of the demon.</p>

<p class="centered">He picks his next victim. He continues as the screams of the students echo. Izumi's hands start to bleed from the pressure of him clenching. Hitsumi notices it and looks at his face, filled with despair and rage.</p>

<p class="centered">The demon had already killed nearly a hundred students, and it was looking for its next victim.</p>

<p class="centered">As Hitsumi is about to say something the whole world freezes as she gets grabbed by the demon.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi's eyes widened in shock. Hitsumi's face is filled with terror. <strong><em>"Shuraaa"</em></strong>, it whispers.</p>

<p class="centered">She remained silent; the demon scoffed. But as the demon opened its mouth, she couldn't move.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi still chooses not to do anything, but as he clenches his fist, his hand nearly tears off, as he looks down in defeat.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *Izumi.*

<p class="centered">Izumi looks up with tears in his eyes</p>

**Hitsumi:** ***IZUMI!!***

<p class="centered">His sorrow turns into rage. He knew it was better to lie low, but at that moment he couldn't think logically. The only thing on his mind was ... to kill. A familiar bloodlust and an even more familiar voice whispers in his head.... kill. A black mist surrounds his eyes. He un-clenches his fist and jumps over the railings. As he lands on the ground and walks out of the dust, his sclera slowly becomes black, and his iris is gold.</p>

<p class="centered">His hand completely heals as he stares down the demon.</p>

<p class="centered">The demon gets ready to jump at him, but as he begins to leap, he is brought down to his knees, just from Izumi's eyes. He walks over to the demon, but to a human, it seems like he almost teleported.</p>

<p class="centered">He holds the demon's head in his palm</p>

**???:** What do you fear the most?

**Demon:** (with his voice trembling) *stutters*

**???:** SAY IT!

**Demon:** y-y-you....

**???:** (he strengthens his grip) WHAT'S MY NAME!

<p class="centered">Even though the demon had never met him before, he was smart enough to know that this presence could only be one person...... or thing.</p>

<p class="centered"><em>[Blurred Fragment]</em></p>

**Demon:** Sh-sh-sh-sh-shuuu-raa.

**???:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">He begins to laugh out loud.</p>

**Shura:** THAT'S RIGHT. I AM

**Demon:** *shudders*

**Shura:** *SHURAAA*

<p class="centered">He crushes the demon's head in his hands. Blood splatters everywhere as he continues laughing.</p>


<p class="centered"><em>To be continued...</em></p>
