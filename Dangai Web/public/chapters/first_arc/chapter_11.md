<p class="centered">The next day, Izumi meets Hitsumi in class.</p>

**Izumi:** Hey, how are you?

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* I'm good, you?

**Izumi:** After yesterday, pretty good.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs*.

**Izumi:** *laughs*. How's your arm?

<p class="centered">She inspects the cut on her arm, bandaged up.</p>

**Hitsumi:** It's fine.

**Izumi:** Good.

**Hitsumi:** Did you learn for the calculus test?

**Izumi:** Yeah, wait, what test?

**Hitsumi:** You forgot about it, didn't you?

**Izumi:** Shit.

**Hitsumi:** *laughs*

**Izumi:** Well, it's fine, I'll manage.

**Hitsumi:** It won't be your first time.

<p class="centered">The teacher walks in as the bell rings and everyone stands up</p>

**Teacher:** Alright, guys, I hope you're ready.

<p class="centered">The teacher distributes the question papers.</p>

<p class="centered">He starts going through the paper.</p>

**Izumi:** This should be easy.

<p class="centered">As his pen touches the paper, he hears an explosion.</p>

<p class="centered">Screams of students flood the hallways</p>

**Izumi:** What the hell was that?

<p class="centered">All the students rush out and see that the center of the school is destroyed. The top of the school was broken as if something had crashed. The entire place was on fire. But most terrifying of all, as he looked down, he saw something he never wanted to see again.</p>

<p class="centered">Among the tons of debris, he saw......</p>

<p class="centered"><strong><em>A DEMON</em></strong>.</p>

**???:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">He begins to laugh out loud.</p>

**Shura:** THAT'S RIGHT. I AM

**Demon:** *shudders*

**Shura:** *SHURAAA*

<p class="centered">He crushes the demon's head in his hands. Blood splatters everywhere as he continues laughing.</p>
