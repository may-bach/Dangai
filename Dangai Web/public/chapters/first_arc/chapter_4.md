Chapter 4

Hitsumi: So, how do we start?

Izumi: Aoi, you ready?

Aoi: I’ve been ready for a long time now.

<p class="centered">The vines from the trees start growing out and take the form of a portal</p>

Aoi: You’re going to O-Ten, right?

Izumi: Yep.

Hitsumi: What’s that?

Izumi: It’s the capital of Dangai, right at the center.

Hitsumi: Why are we going there?

Izumi: To meet someone.

Hitsumi: And who is this someone?

Izumi: My best friend.

<p class="centered">The portal lights up, and you can see a huge city on the other side</p>

Aoi: Alright, you’re up.

Izumi: Come on, let’s go.

Hitsumi: Wait, is this safe, for a human, I mean?

Izumi: You’ll be fine, I think.

Hitsumi: You think—woahhh

<p class="centered">She screams as Izumi drags her through</p>

Izumi: Catch you later, bro.

Aoi: smiles bye

<p class="centered">The portal closes on Aoi’s side. They exit on the other side, but Izumi looks confused as they end up in what looks like the middle of the desert with no sun</p>

Hitsumi: Looks pretty barren for a capital.

Izumi: This is not O-Ten.

Hitsumi: Wait, where are we?

Izumi: I don’t know.

Hitsumi: Oh her smile slowly turns into anger YOU DON’T WHAT!!!!! I FOLLOW YOU TO THIS PLACE WHERE I DON’T KNOW, TRUSTING IN YOU AND-

Izumi: Wait a minute-

Hitsumi: YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

Izumi: Hey, chill out

Hitsumi: HONESTLY, I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING-

Izumi: SHUT UP.

<p class="centered">Everything goes silent</p>

Izumi: Let me finish. takes a breath I know where we are.

Hitsumi: Oh, you should’ve said that.

Izumi: Well, technically.

Hitsumi: Technically? There’s nothing technical about it. You either do or you don’t.

Izumi: I know the place we’re in, but not exactly our location.

Hitsumi: Explain.

Izumi: We’re in what we call the nameless.

Hitsumi: What kind of name is that?

Izumi: A brilliant one, as it perfectly sums up what this place is.

Hitsumi: Which is?

Izumi: It’s a place where nothing exists.

Hitsumi: What do you mean?

Izumi: Dangai is a complicated plane. The capital city O-Ten is a huge city located at the center with walls all around, secluding it from the outside world.

Hitsumi: So, why is this place “nameless”?

Izumi: smiles and clears throat Dangai can be split into 5 parts. The first in the center is O-Ten, surrounding which there is a huge ocean, kind of like a moat. Then there is a forest, which serves as a kind of barrier between O-Ten and the next part, the outskirts. It is the border of Dangai. It is made up of a lot of these small villages. It is the most populated place in Dangai.

Hitsumi: Why aren’t any of these places connected to Dangai?

<p class="centered">Izumi’s eyes go dark</p>

Izumi: Racism.

Hitsumi: Racism?

Izumi: Yes, well not exactly racism. It’s people who are not pure.

Hitsumi: Pure?

Izumi: Pure blooded. Humans in Dangai have angel blood which makes us stronger. Using which we can also tap into angelic powers and magic etc. They were meant to be a gift, but we managed to make even that into a way of discrimination based on how much of your blood was angelic. Anyone with less than 25% angelic blood, were considered impure and excommunicated to the outskirts, where they are forced to fend for themselves in the wilderness, while the people in power look down on them and insult them. The only way they could ever make it to the capital was if they were either sold as slaves or recruited as soldiers, just to be put on the frontline and die meaningless deaths.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi’s eyes widen as Izumi forms a fist.</p>

Izumi: Even the police sent to maintain justice just extort them and take advantage of the fact that no one would ask. They were forced to live as lifeless beings; objects in their eyes.

<p class="centered">She looks at him concerned. Izumi sighs, and his hand loosens.</p>

Izumi: Well, at least that’s no longer the case, thanks to her.

Hitsumi: You mean…

Izumi: Yeah, her. She worked her ass off, and it paid off. She changed how everyone viewed each other. smiles We were even able to build a portal from all the main points of the outskirts to O-Ten.

Hitsumi: smiles I see.

<p class="centered">Slowly, her smile turns into a frown, and she shouts at him</p>

Hitsumi: YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHY THIS PLACE IS NAMELESS.

Izumi: Oh yeah, my bad. (he says as he sticks his tongue out and rubs his hair). That brings me to the fifth part, the nameless. It lies outside the borders of the outskirts.

Hitsumi: Why is there a huge border around the outskirts? Can’t you just let the people expand?

Izumi: he looks at her, confused Oh yeah, there's still something about Dangai that you don’t know.

Hitsumi: Which is? Folds her hands

Izumi: Demons can invade Dangai in two ways, one is dungeons, which are present all around Dangai, except in O-Ten. That was considered too much of a risk. Raiding these dungeons is one of the best ways to get real experience fighting demons.

Hitsumi: Mmm.

Izumi: But dungeons are heavily guarded with complex mechanisms. So, it’s really hard for demons to invade through them. But they can’t open gates the border either as it is guarded by divine protection.

Hitsumi: So, they use the other way?

Izumi: Yes, Invading from the nameless.

Hitsumi: Mmhmm. That makes sense.

Izumi: And also, Dangai is infinite.

Hitsumi: Oh. WHAT?!

Izumi: Yeah, the nameless extends forever.

Hitsumi: SO, WE ARE LOST IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

Izumi: Yes.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi slowly starts to faint upon the realization</p>

Izumi: But fret not. I know which direction we have to travel towards.

Hitsumi: How?

Izumi: I share a… complex connection with Dangai. So, I always know where I am.

Hitsumi: How?

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles and rubs her head</p>

Izumi: I’ll tell you later. For now let's go.

<p class="centered">He looks towards her and she looks confused. He grabs her lifts her up on his back</p>

Izumi: This will be faster.

Hitsumi: sighs Fine.

<p class="centered">-----------------------After 3 hours-----------------------</p>

Hitsumi: exhales, how much, exhales, longer with her tongue hanging out in thirst

Izumi: Soon.

Hitsumi: I thought you were fast.

Izumi: And I thought you were light.

Hitsumi: EXCUSE ME, WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

Izumi: laughs I’m joking, I’m joking.

Hitsumi: Well, it's not funny.

Izumi: Why are you even tired? I’m the one carrying you.

Hitsumi: WHY? BECAUSE IT’S HOT.

Izumi: I mean, it’s not that hot.

Hitsumi: IT’S PROBABLY 45 DEGREES.

Izumi: I guess compared to Earth, it's pretty hot.

Hitsumi: You mean you find this normal?

Izumi: I mean, not exactly. Dangai’s weather is pretty erratic. But I'm just used to hotter.

Hitsumi: It gets hotter than this?!

Izumi: Not usually, but I'm used to these temperatures because of my time in hell.

Hitsumi: Oh…WHAT?

Izumi: ?

Hitsumi: YOU’VE BEEN TO HELL?

Izumi: Well, yeah, a few times.

Hitsumi: Well, I'm not even surprised anymore. To be honest, you deserve to be there.

Izumi: looks at her uninterested

Hitsumi: What, that was funny.

Izumi: Yeah, sure. smiles

Hitsumi: Mmph. smiles. So how long will it take for us to reach there?

Izumi: In about an hour.

Hitsumi: WHAT?!

Izumi: Chill, you won't even notice the time fly by.

Hitsumi: I already am…

Izumi: Hey, I could go faster ok, but your body won't be able to handle it.

Hitsumi: breathes heavily

<p class="centered">Suddenly his face goes serious as he feels someone about to attack them</p>

<p class="centered">Out of nowhere, a spear is thrown at them</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi dodges it right on time and comes to a stop</p>

Hitsumi: WHAT WAS THAT! I THOUGHT YOU SAID NO ONE EXISTS HERE.

Izumi: There isn’t supposed to be. Why would anyone wander out of Dangai this far?

Hitsumi: Whatever the reason, he’s trying to kill us, take him down.

Izumi: Wow, you’re an aggressive little one aren’t you?

Hitsumi: I'm a fan of staying alive.

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles and changes his focus towards where the spear came from.</p>

Hitsumi: WHAT ARE THOSE?

<p class="centered">He looks up in the sky and sees a group of soldiers on griffins.</p>

Izumi: smirks our ride home.

<p class="centered"><em>To be continued...</em></p>
