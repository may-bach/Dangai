<!-- PART 1 -->

<p class="centered">A guy lies on the floor with his left arm covering his eyes and playing with a ball with his right.</p>

<p class="centered">He has his earbuds plugged in as he talks to his friend on the phone</p>

<p class="centered">He throws the ball up and catches it before throwing it up again.</p>

**???:** The classes are about to start man, it's the first class of the year.

<p class="centered">The guy responds without stopping the ball</p>

**???:** Man, chill out. This is our second year, you should know the teacher doesn't care.

<p class="centered">The teacher yells over Kenji's phone</p>

**Teacher:** KENJI, PUT DOWN THE PHONE.

**Kenji:** I think, this one cares a bit.

<p class="centered">He looks up at the teacher</p>

**Kenji:** Just a minute teach, it's my father. It's really important.

**???:** *smiles* You can call me daddy anytime man.

**Kenji:** COME TO CLASS.

<p class="centered">He gets up and starts bouncing the ball off the wall instead.</p>

**???:** You really gotta try harder to convince me to attend a Calculus class at 8 on a Monday morning.

<p class="centered">Kenji takes a breath and calms down</p>

**Kenji:** You know how this time first years and second years, have the same class for math.

**???:** Yeah?

**Kenji:** *clears his throat* The first year girls are hot.

<p class="centered">The ball lands on the floor as he is no longer there.</p>

<p class="centered">The students walking in the corridor make way as the guy runs while barely grabbing onto his bag</p>

**???:** You should've told me sooner man.

**Kenji:** Yeah, you're right, maybe I should've. Make your way to class quick.

<p class="centered">He cuts the call, and Izumi smiles and he speeds up</p>

<p class="centered">As he keeps his phone in his pocket his shoulders hit a girl walking in the opposite direction right on the head</p>

<p class="centered">He turns around momentarily to apologize.</p>

<p class="centered">She glares at him furiously, and he could predict the situation which would unfold.</p>

**Girl:** DO YOU NOT PAY ATTENTION TO -

<p class="centered">Not wanting to listen to her argue, he ignores her and continues running.</p>

**Girl:** HEY, COME BACK HERE.

<p class="centered">He finally reaches class and grabs onto the doorpost to swing into the class entrance and halts</p>

**Teacher:** And who are you?

**???:** A student of this class?

**Teacher:** Great another smart ass. Come here and show your name in the register.

<p class="centered">He walks over slowly gesturing hi towards Kenji with a smile.</p>

<p class="centered">He takes a look at the register and runs his finger down looking for his name.</p>

**???:** Anddd, there.

**Teacher:** Kurosaki Izumi?

**Izumi:** That's me.

**Teacher:** You're that Kurosaki.

**Izumi:** I'm not really sure what that means, but I'm inclined to say yes.

**Teacher:** *exhales deeply* Why do I always get these students?! I just wanna earn enough to support my family.

<p class="centered">Izumi stands there confused</p>

**Teacher:** Go take a seat, and please don't ask any doubts.

**Izumi:** Don't worry, I don't plan on.

<p class="centered">He says as he smiles and looks around the class for the girls and spots a few.</p>

**Teacher:** Alright class settle down.

<p class="centered">Izumi walks over to Kenji sitting in the last row, and sets his bag down and takes a seat with his legs resting on the table.</p>

**Kenji:** What do you think?

**Izumi:** The two on the left are good, so is the one in the first row. But I'm more interested the on two rows in front of us.

**Kenji:** Oh, I heard she's a rich girl, daddy's princess type shit.

**Izumi:** *grins* I like a challenge.

<p class="centered">Izumi taps the shoulder of the guy in front of him.</p>

**Izumi:** Move over.

**The guy glances back, annoyed:** I'm trying to—

**Izumi:** Thanks.

<p class="centered">He stands on his desk. Kenji's eyes widen.</p>

**Kenji:** (whispered) Dude, what are you—

<p class="centered">Izumi vaults forward, landing on the next desk with a thud. The guy sitting there jerks back.</p>

**Guy:** What the hell?

<p class="centered">Izumi side vaults over his table, landing in the empty seat beside Layla.</p>

<p class="centered">He puts his arm around her and smiles.</p>

**Izumi:** Hey, how are you?

**???:** *smirks* I know what you're about, my friend's a senior, she's told me a lot about you.

**Izumi:** Woah, so you've done your research.

**???:** You could say that.

**Izumi:** So what's Ms. Pretty's name.

**Layla:** It's Layla.

**Izumi:** Oh, you're from the US?

**Layla:** What gave it away, the blonde hair?

**Izumi:** You'd be surprised how many girls dye their hair to look more American.

<p class="centered">Layla laughs</p>

**Izumi:** So, since you're new, I was thinking I could offer to take some time out of my busy day to give you a tour of the place.

**Layla:** Wow, really. That's very generous, but as I said, my friends a senior, she can give me the tour.

**Izumi:** Oh, are you sure? I know a lot about the university which even your friend wouldn't know.

**Layla:** Yeah, I'm sure. I already made plans with her.

**Izumi:** *sighs and smiles* Well you win some, you lose some.

<p class="centered">He takes his arm from around her and gets ready to jump back</p>

<p class="centered">As he is about to she grabs his arm.</p>

**Layla:** Wait.

**Izumi:** Hmm?

**Layla:** I didn't hear the best things about you, but you seem like a nice guy. What about after she gives me a tour we can grab coffee.

**Izumi:** *smirks* Of course, there's this really good coffee place I know downtown.

**Layla:** Great.

<p class="centered">She hands him a paper with her number</p>

**Izumi:** Perfect, I'll pick you up.

<p class="centered">She smiles and let's go of his arm and he jumps back to the table behind him and the guy moves to the right to leave him space as he gets mad.</p>

<p class="centered">Then he backflips back into his seat and rests his legs on the table again.</p>

<p class="centered">The teacher notices everything and decides to ignore it.</p>

**Teacher:** I hate my life.

<p class="centered">He continues writing formulae on the board.</p>

**Kenji:** So?

<p class="centered">Izumi shows him the paper and smiles while looking straight.</p>

**Kenji:** Nicee. That was easier than I expected.

**Izumi:** Yeah, her friend tried to make it harder for me, but she just ended up helping me.

**Kenji:** How?

**Izumi:** If you tell a girl like that to not do something, she's just going to wanna do it more.

**Kenji:** Who's her friend?

**Izumi:** Who knows? Probably some other girls I used to talk to.

<p class="centered">He slowly closes his eyes and begins to sleep.</p>

**Kenji:** You're just gonna go back to sleep.

**Izumi:** I was about to when you called me, just continuing the job I left off.

**Kenji:** Alright I'll wake you up after the class is over.

<p class="centered">Izumi shows a thumbs up, leans on the chair and goes back to sleep.</p>

<p class="centered">The bell rings and all the students leave the class.</p>

**Teacher:** Alright guys, we'll continue where we-

<p class="centered">Before he could finish he realizes almost all the students have left the class, and looks down depressed</p>

**Teacher:** I hate my job.

<p class="centered">He walks out in defeat leaving Kenji and Izumi alone in the class.</p>

<p class="centered">He nudges him but he refuses to wake up</p>

**Kenji:** Hey man, the next class students are gonna start coming any second now, wake up. Our next class is two blocks away.

**Izumi:** What? Why?

**Kenji:** The first years have some kind of orientation in this class now. So, for the rest of the day our classes are shifted.

<p class="centered">Izumi pushes him away and turns to his side</p>

**Izumi:** 10 more minutes. Besides, there might be some cute girls.

<p class="centered">Kenji accepts defeat and leaves the room as the next class students start entering.</p>

**Kenji:** Fine, suit yourself, don't say I didn't try.

<p class="centered">As he makes his exit the students start filling the benches except the on he is sitting one.</p>

<p class="centered">All four rows get filled with two students in each table except the corner last row towards the window, occupied by Izumi.</p>

<p class="centered">The next teacher walks in and all the students stand up to greet him.</p>

**Students:** Good morning Madam.

**Teacher:** Take a seat. I'm Ms. Aoki. I'll be your handler I guess you could say as long you're here in this university. I hope we can get along.

**Aoki:** Today I'll be giving you a brief rundown of how thing work in this university.

<p class="centered">The studious students in the front row take out books to note down what she says, while the students a bit farther behind talked amongst themselves.</p>

<p class="centered">Meanwhile, Izumi continued to sleep in the last row completely undisturbed.</p>

<p class="centered">Half an hour passes and as the class is about to come to a close, she notices him sleeping in the tenth and last row.</p>

**Aoki:** Excuse me, you in the back.

<p class="centered">Izumi continues to snore without a care in the world.</p>

**Aoki:** HEY, YOU IN THE LAST.

**Izumi:** *snores*.

<p class="centered">With perfect bowling form, she picks up a marker and throws it at him.</p>

<p class="centered">It makes it's way to his head without losing any speed.</p>

**Student 1:** She must be a baseball fan.

<p class="centered">The marker flies towards Izumi, but before it could hit he notices something and catches it while keeping his eyes closed.</p>

<p class="centered">He slowly wakes up yawning and rubbing his eyes.</p>

**Izumi:** Teach, I think you dropped this.

<p class="centered">All the students start laughing and Izumi looks confused.</p>

<p class="centered">He looks up and sees the teacher looking at him furiously, and realizes his situation.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh.

**Aoki:** Did you even listen to a word I said.

**Izumi:** Umm.

**Aoki:** Of course you didn't.

<p class="centered">She looks at the rest of the class.</p>

**Aoki:** For the rest of you, don't be like this guy, or you'll end up failing your first year here.

<p class="centered">Everyone laughs including Izumi.</p>

**Aoki:** Why are you laughing?

**Izumi:** Oh, sorry.

**Aoki:** Why did you come to this university? This is quite a prestigious university, how did you even get in? Daddy's money?

**Izumi:** Well, I'd have you know I did get in by merit. As for your first question, I came here cause I heard this place has the best girls.

<p class="centered">Everyone laughs except the teacher.</p>

**Aoki:** WHAT'S YOUR NAME!

**Izumi:** *smiles* Kurosaki, Izumi Kurosaki.

**Aoki:** Wait, I've heard that name before.

<p class="centered">All the students start murmuring amongst themselves realizing who he is.</p>

**Aoki:** You're that second year delinquent. Why are you here? This class is for first years.

**Izumi:** Umm.

<p class="centered">As she was about to scold him again, the bell rings.</p>

**Aoki:** *exhales* You, meet me outside. As for the rest of you, stay here, the next teacher will give you a more in depth analysis of the academic structure of the university.

<p class="centered">She points to him again and signals him to come out.</p>

<p class="centered">He sighs and starts packing his bag.</p>

<p class="centered">Meanwhile.</p>

<p class="centered">A girl sitting in the first row plays with her pen.</p>

<p class="centered">She looks around her and notices everyone talking about him.</p>

<p class="centered">She takes interest in his character but doesn't turn around to look at him.</p>

**???:** (Interesting, everyone seems to know who he is. I mean I shouldn't be surprised, I never really do a whole lot of research into the students.)

<p class="centered">She asks the girl next to her about him</p>

**???:** Hey, who is he?

**Girl:** You don't know?

<p class="centered">She looks at her with a straight face</p>

**Girl:** Fair enough, stupid question. That's Izumi. He got perfect scores in every subject in his midterms but barely passed his finals.

**???:** How?

**Girl:** I don't know, they say he does it on purpose cause he doesn't wanna stand out.

**???:** Well clearly whatever he's doing isn't working.

<p class="centered">As he walks out all the girls start screaming, to which he smiles and waves.</p>

**Girl:** I guess he's more well known for talking to every girl he finds cute.

**???:** So a playboy?

**Girl:** You could say that.

**???:** Great (sarcastically).

**Girl:** Yeah, I don't really like him.

**???:** Uh huh.

<p class="centered">As Izumi approaches the first row even the girl starts screaming.</p>

**Girl:** HIII IZUMI.

**???:** *sighs* so much for not liking him.

<p class="centered">The girl smiles at her awkwardly.</p>

<p class="centered">She rolls her eyes and slowly turns around to look at him</p>

**???:** Just who is this guy.

<p class="centered">As Izumi walks past her bench to the exit, she turns back and they look at each other.</p>

**Izumi:** Have we met before?

<p class="centered">He thinks back and realizes that she was the girl he ran into earlier that day.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh.

**???:** Wait, you are…

<p class="centered">She realizes as well.</p>

<p class="centered">He smiles innocently as he rubs his neck.</p>

**Izumi:** (Shit).</p>
