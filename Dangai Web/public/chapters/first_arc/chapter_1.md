<p class="centered">The next day, Izumi meets Hitsumi in class.</p>

**Izumi:** Hey, how are you?

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* I'm good, you?

**Izumi:** After yesterday, pretty good.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs*.

**Izumi:** *laughs*. How's your arm?

<p class="centered">She inspects the cut on her arm, bandaged up.</p>

**Hitsumi:** It's fine.

**Izumi:** Good.

**Hitsumi:** Did you learn for the calculus test?

**Izumi:** Yeah, wait, what test?

**Hitsumi:** You forgot about it, didn't you?

**Izumi:** Shit.

**Hitsumi:** *laughs*

**Izumi:** Well, it's fine, I'll manage.

**Hitsumi:** It won't be your first time.

<p class="centered">The teacher walks in as the bell rings and everyone stands up</p>

**Teacher:** Alright, guys, I hope you're ready.

<p class="centered">The teacher distributes the question papers.</p>

<p class="centered">He starts going through the paper.</p>

**Izumi:** This should be easy.

<p class="centered">As his pen touches the paper, he hears an explosion.</p>

<p class="centered">Screams of students flood the hallways</p>

**Izumi:** What the hell was that?

<p class="centered">All the students rush out and see that the center of the school is destroyed. The top of the school was broken as if something had crashed. The entire place was on fire. But most terrifying of all, as he looked down, he saw something he never wanted to see again.</p>

<p class="centered">Among the tons of debris, he saw......</p>

<p class="centered"><strong><em>A DEMON</em></strong>.</p>

<p class="centered">All the students started screaming as they hid behind the walls and rocks. The demon begins growling. It looks at the students.</p>

<p class="centered">Suddenly, he was holding one of them, it seemed instant. The guy started screaming, but it didn't last long. Killing him, he shouted <strong><em>"SHURAAA."</em></strong> It became silent. Izumi clenches his fist but stays back without doing anything.</p>

**Izumi:** Shit, I can't. It's not worth it. God, have mercy on his soul.

<p class="centered">The guy starts to scream louder. The demon looks at him and whispers again, <strong><em>"Shuraaa."</em></strong> The guy goes silent. The demon bites his head off. All the students start to scream louder. But they are silenced by the roars of the demon.</p>

<p class="centered">He picks his next victim. He continues as the screams of the students echo. Izumi's hands start to bleed from the pressure of him clenching. Hitsumi notices it and looks at his face, filled with despair and rage.</p>

<p class="centered">The demon had already killed nearly a hundred students, and it was looking for its next victim.</p>

<p class="centered">As Hitsumi is about to say something the whole world freezes as she gets grabbed by the demon.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi's eyes widened in shock. Hitsumi's face is filled with terror. <strong><em>"Shuraaa"</em></strong>, it whispers.</p>

<p class="centered">She remained silent; the demon scoffed. But as the demon opened its mouth, she couldn't move.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi still chooses not to do anything, but as he clenches his fist, his hand nearly tears off, as he looks down in defeat.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *Izumi.*

<p class="centered">Izumi looks up with tears in his eyes</p>

**Hitsumi:** ***IZUMI!!***

<p class="centered">His sorrow turns into rage. He knew it was better to lie low, but at that moment he couldn't think logically. The only thing on his mind was ... to kill. A familiar bloodlust and an even more familiar voice whispers in his head.... kill. A black mist surrounds his eyes. He un-clenches his fist and jumps over the railings. As he lands on the ground and walks out of the dust, his sclera slowly becomes black, and his iris is gold.</p>

<p class="centered">His hand completely heals as he stares down the demon.</p>

<p class="centered">The demon gets ready to jump at him, but as he begins to leap, he is brought down to his knees, just from Izumi's eyes. He walks over to the demon, but to a human, it seems like he almost teleported.</p>

<p class="centered">He holds the demon's head in his palm</p>

**???:** What do you fear the most?

**Demon:** *with his voice trembling* *stutters*

**???:** SAY IT!

**Demon:** y-y-you....

**???:** *he strengthens his grip* WHAT'S MY NAME!

<p class="centered">Even though the demon had never met him before, he was smart enough to know that this presence could only be one person...... or thing.</p>

<p class="centered"><em>[Blurred Fragment]</em></p>

**Demon:** Sh-sh-sh-sh-shuuu-raa.

**???:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">He begins to laugh out loud.</p>

**Shura:** THAT'S RIGHT. I AM

**Demon:** *shudders*

**Shura:** *SHURAAA*

<p class="centered">He crushes the demon's head in his hands. Blood splatters everywhere as he continues laughing.</p>

<p class="centered">As he was about to go to check on Hitsumi, about 10 more demons arrived, one of which seemed stronger and more human than the rest.</p>

**???:** Shura Shura Shura. After eons of hiding, you finally decided to show yourself to aid a human. *laughs* I guess he overestimated you. *Slams the ground with his giant sword.* My name is Zabuza, commander of the 136th division of the Devils Guard.

<p class="centered">Izumi turns towards the demon.</p>

**Zabuza:** To guess that God's perfect side project would be helping an earthling. How far you've fallen, Shura.

<p class="centered">All the demons start laughing as Hitsumi looks in confusion. Izumi looks down and smiles. He starts to laugh, which makes the demons uneasy.</p>

**Zabuza:** *stops smiling* What's so funny?

**Shura:** Nothing, it's just that. The last time I fought your kind, there was more fighting and less talking. I guess you guys have become soft as well.

**Zabuza:** Why you? *angrily*

<p class="centered">He tries to spread his aura. As his aura envelops the field. The slightest exposure and the students would've died. But, before anything serious can happen, Izumi smiles.</p>

**Shura:** I guess even your Sakai has degraded over time.

**Zabuza:** *gnashes his teeth*

**Shura:** Let me show you a real one.

<p class="centered">The gold in his eyes shines brightly, and it overpowers the Sakai of Zabuza. Zabuza struggles to even stand. All the other demons implode without being able to handle his Sakai. Izumi starts walking over to Zabuza. He tries to move, he tries to pick up his sword, but it's in vain, as he realizes that his hands are trembling, and he can't move.</p>

**Zabuza:** What is this power? This feeling. What are you?

**Shura:** *smiles* Don't think you survived my Sakai. It's just that I didn't want you dead just yet.

**Zabuza:** Kill me, 'cause you're not getting anything else outta me.

**Shura:** Oh really, well, even if I were to kill you, nothing wrong with causing a little pain before. *Smiles psychotically*

**Zabuza:** DO YOUR WORST!

<p class="centered">Izumi takes his hand towards him, but Zabuza maintains a straight face as he looks into his eyes. He lifts him by the neck.</p>

**Shura:** Wow, you're pretty respectable. You know what, I think I'll let you live. Get stronger and challenge me again. If your master lets you live.

<p class="centered">Zabuza braces himself. Izumi crushes his neck and throws him to the side. And Zabuza's eyes were filled with anger. Frustrated at the difference in strength between them, but feeling helpless, he goes back to hell. Izumi's eyes return to normal. He looks at his hands and realizes what he's done. It starts to rain. Then, he looks over at Hitsumi. They couldn't say anything as the blood slowly flowed down from his body with the rain and mixed with the other blood and flowed into a nearby river, painting the river red.</p>

<p class="centered">[Blurred Fragment]</p>

<p class="centered">After a moment of silence</p>

**Izumi:** I can't believe this is how it ends. It's my fault.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks down in despair as he reminisces about their memories. He gnashes his teeth and keeps his finger on his ear.</p>

**Izumi:** Aoi, can u hear me?

<p class="centered">A voice speaks in his head.</p>

**Aoi:** Of course. What is it you want?

**Izumi:** Create a gate to you.

**Aoi:** Really, after so long you're just going to connect to me and ask me to bring you here.

**Izumi:** This is serious.

**Aoi:** Ahhh, alright. You've never been one to take no for an answer. Creating a gate, we have a lot to talk about.

<p class="centered">A portal gets created and he starts walking towards it.</p>

**Izumi:** ALRIGHT EVERYONE, SORRY FOR ALL THE COMMOTION I'VE CAUSED AND THE CASUALITIES AND INJURIES. I'M TRULY SORRY. THEY'RE PROBABLY IN A BETTER PLACEâ€¦. IF THEY DESERVED IT.

<p class="centered">He looks over at Hitsumi</p>

**Izumi:** I'm sorry, but this is the end.

<p class="centered">He turns around and starts to walk toward the portal, then suddenly she grabs his hand.</p>

**Izumi:** What? Let me go,

**Hitsumi:** No, I won't let you go.

**Izumi:** Why?

**Hitsumi:** Because I'm not letting you leave me behind.

**Izumi:** What?!

**Hitsumi:** Yes.

**Izumi:** Are you high? Look around you. All of this is because of me. I'm responsible for all of it.

**Hitsumi:** Well, maybe so. I don't know what's going on right now. I don't know what those were. And to be honest, I feel like I don't even know who you are. But I know that you're my partner.

**Izumi:** ARE YOU LISTENING TO YOURSELF? YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

**Hitsumi:** I KNOW ENOUGH.

<p class="centered">Izumi pulls his hand out.</p>

**Izumi:** Just continue your life without me.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi pulls him back. As he turns around, she slaps him.</p>

**Hitsumi:** WHAT LIFE?

<p class="centered">He stares at her in silence</p>

**Hitsumi:** My parents died, I have no friends.

**Izumi:** I'm sorry.

**Hitsumi:** Don't leave.

**Izumi:** Don't you understand, I want to, but I can't stay here. Those things will keep attacking until they find me again.

<p class="centered">She thinks for some time.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Where are you going then?

**Izumi:** To where I came from.

**Hitsumi:** *loosens grip*

<p class="centered">Izumi starts to walk towards the portal again.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *tightens grip* wait.

<p class="centered">Izumi turns around and looks up to him.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Take me with you.

**Izumi:** EXCUSE ME?!

**Hitsumi:** Why, take me with you.

**Izumi:** You don't even know where I'm going, let alone how dangerous it is.

**Hitsumi:** It's fine, take me with you.

**Izumi:** No. Out of the question.

**Hitsumi:** WHY?

**Izumi:** YOU WILL DIE!

**Hitsumi:** YOU WON'T LET ME!

**Izumi:** *sighs frustratedly*

**Izumi:** *confused* But. Why?

**Hitsumi:** Because I want to.

**Izumi:** My God, why are you so annoying?

**Hitsumi:** I don't care.

**Aoi:** Izumi, make it quick, I'm getting bored.

**Izumi:** Just wait for some time.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at Hitsumi as she looks at him with pleading eyes</p>

**Izumi:** Do you know what you're getting yourself into?

**Hitsumi:** Yes.

**Izumi:** *thinks for some time and takes a deep breath* Fine, do what you want.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* Really. *Hugs him*

**Izumi:** *hugs her back* But you know what you're sacrificing, right?

**Hitsumi:** Mmm.

**Izumi:** You're crazy, you know that.

**Hitsumi:** But you said I'm a genius.

**Izumi:** You can be both.

**Hitsumi:** *laughs*

**Izumi:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">Izumi looks towards the portal and picks her up.</p>

**Izumi:** *(How did I get myself into this? Why did I get myself into this? Maybe because she's different. Maybe because she's special. Or, maybe it's just because.)* *Looks at her as she smiles*

<p class="centered">[Blurred Fragment]</p>

**Izumi:** *(Because she is just like her)*

<p class="centered">They enter the portal together</p>

<p class="centered"><em>To be continued...</em></p>
