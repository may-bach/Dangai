<p class="centered">*A rooster crows as the next day rolls around*</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi groans, peeling himself off his bedsheets. He moves through his morning routine with the speed of a sloth. He brushes his teeth, eyes half-closed. He showers. He pulls on his classic outfit---white tee, dark pants. And finally he puts on his black denim jacket.</p>

<p class="centered">He goes out and takes the elevator down to the basement to pick up his bike.</p>

<p class="centered">He checks his pockets and realizes he forgot his key.</p>

**Izumi:** (Shit).

<p class="centered">As he sighs and turns around to go back all the way up to the 70th floor, Kenji brakes his motorcycle in front of him and smiles.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi responds with a smile as well and hops on the back.</p>

**Kenji:** You coming to class today?

**Izumi:** Of course not.

**Kenji:** Figured.

**Izumi:** I'll just walk with you till class and go sleep free room or something.

<p class="centered">They park their motorcycle outside the academic block for CSE.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi leads Kenji to the elevator.</p>

**Kenji:** It's just 6 floors man.

**Izumi:** Just?

**Kenji:** Come on, it will be good cardio.

<p class="centered">He brushes him off and waits for the elevator, and Kenji surrenders.</p>

<p class="centered">They get on and exit the elevator in silence and pace down the hallway towards their class.</p>

**Kenji:** You have a date today, right, with Chloe?

**Izumi:** Oh yeah, that too, hopefully nothing pops up today.

<p class="centered">As they are walking to class, they get cut off.</p>

**???:** Good morning, Kurosaki.

<p class="centered">He freezes in fear and turns around slowly, hoping it's not who he thinks it is.</p>

**Izumi:** *awkward smile* Good morning Ms. Aoki.

**Aoki:** Where are you headed?

**Izumi:** Class, where else?

**Aoki:** I believe your friend is going to class, but are you?

**Izumi:** Sure I am.

<p class="centered">She gives him a look that says she knows exactly what his attendance record looks like.</p>

**Izumi:** Maybe not?

**Aoki:** Good, follow me.

**Izumi:** What, why should I-

<p class="centered">*Izumi and Aoki stand outside her classroom.*</p>

<p class="centered">Through the window, Izumi watches students playing football in the sports field, longing to be there.</p>

**Aoki:** Stay out.

<p class="centered">He sighs and leans against the wall.</p>

<p class="centered">Inside, the students greet Ms. Aoki.</p>

**Students:** Good morning, Ms. Aoki.

**Aoki:** Good morning, students. Today I won't be taking a class. Just revise everything we learnt about quantum mechanics yesterday.

<p class="centered">Celebratory whispers ripple through the room.</p>

**Aoki:** Ms. Miyamoto. Meet me outside.

<p class="centered">She gets caught off guard but agrees and walks out with her.</p>

**Hitsumi:** What's the matter, Ms. Aoki?

**Aoki:** You wanted to know who's your head right.

<p class="centered">Izumi hears voices and turns around lazily. Aoki gestures toward him.</p>

**Aoki:** Meet your head, Kurosaki Izumi. Kurosaki, meet your assistant, Miyamoto Hitsumi.

<p class="centered">As they look at each other, the calm before the storm ensues.</p>

<p class="centered">They look at each other in silence as the realization slowly sets in.</p>

**Izumi:** Eh.

**Hitsumi:** Eh.

**Izumi & Hitsumi:** EHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

**Izumi:** SENSEI, WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

**Hitsumi:** I SHOULD BE ASKING THAT.

**Aoki:** Alright, alright, calm down.

**Izumi:** Calm? THIS IS THE LAST PERSON I WANT TO BE WORKING WITH.

**Hitsumi:** WHY ARE YOU MAD? I'M THE ONE WHO SHOULD BE OUTRAGED. WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO WORK WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU?!

**Aoki:** Alright, you two, quiet down.

**Izumi:** YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE WORKING WITH ME! MOST GIRLS IN THERE WOULD KILL TO WORK WITH ME!

**Hitsumi:** WHY YOU...

<p class="centered">They say as they approach and glare at each other.</p>

**Aoki:** BE QUIET!

<p class="centered">Her voice pierces through their clashing and silences them.</p>

<p class="centered">They both turn towards her.</p>

**Aoki:** Listen, you two are going to have to work together, one way or the other.

**Izumi:** But-

**Aoki:** No buts. And I suggest you guys get started working on it right away.

<p class="centered">She hands Hitsumi a paper with a list of clubs and teams.</p>

**Aoki:** That's a list of all the members from our school who will be hosting an event or a shop, etc. Your guy's job is to contact all these teams using the contact and follow up with their preparations. We only have 2 weeks for the event, so you guys need to get a move on. All the best.

**Izumi:** And what are you gonna do?

**Aoki:** Work, Kurosaki. Now get a move on, finish at least 10 groups by today.

<p class="centered">She walks off into the distance, and Izumi and Hitsumi are left with each other.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi silently tries to sneak off, but Hitsumi grabs him by the back of his collar.</p>

**Hitsumi:** And where do you think you're going?

**Izumi:** Umm... Nowhere.

<p class="centered">She pulls him back</p>

**Hitsumi:** We have to do 10 by the end of the day, you take care of 5, and I'll take care of 5. That way it's even.

**Izumi:** Yeahhh, about that. I'm actually swamped. So I think you're on your own-

<p class="centered">He tries to escape again, but she grabs him by his ear and pulls him back.</p>

**Izumi:** Ow ow ow ow ow.

**Hitsumi:** You *will* help me.

**Izumi:** Why???

**Hitsumi:** Why? You're the fucking head.

**Izumi:** Well, that just means I handle the executive decision-making. Not slave work.

**Hitsumi:** You don't have a choice.

<p class="centered">He escapes her grip on his ear.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh yeah.

<p class="centered">He walks into the class and addresses the students.</p>

**Izumi:** Alright, guys, listen up. I need 5 volunteers for a fest-related job. And if you decide to join, I'd have to give you my number so that I can follow up with you. So, who's up for the task?

<p class="centered">There's a silence which is soon broken by a huge uproar of girls to volunteer.</p>

**Izumi:** You, you, you... you and there you.

<p class="centered">He randomly points towards five girls to follow him out of the class, and they do.</p>

<p class="centered">He takes a girl's phone and puts his number into it.</p>

**Izumi:** Alright, the rest of you can get the number from her.

<p class="centered">He grabs the sheet from Hitsumi's hands.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hey.

<p class="centered">He sends the girl in the front a message with the names and contact information of the first 5 groups.</p>

**Izumi:** Split the five among yourselves and get back to me about it by tonight. All the best. Now go back to class.

<p class="centered">They get excited and confirm they will finish it and go back in.</p>

<p class="centered">He turns towards Hitsumi and smirks.</p>

**Izumi:** That's what a leader does.

**Hitsumi:** You're not a leader, you just manipulated them to do you bidding.

**Izumi:** Tomato, tomahto.

<p class="centered">He looks away dismissing her.</p>

<p class="centered">She grabs his phone.</p>

**Izumi:** Hey.

**Hitsumi:** A good leader leads by example.

<p class="centered">She saves her number on his phone.</p>

**Hitsumi:** I'll call you tomorrow. Let's see how well your work comes along.

<p class="centered">She grabs the paper back from him and starts walking away.</p>

**Izumi:** Wait, I didn't even give you my number.

**Hitsumi:** You don't need to. I saw it when you typed it into the other girl's phone. I have a good memory.

<p class="centered">Izumi groans, annoyed at the fact that she can contact him now.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Don't forget, (She looks over her shoulder) *You'd better pick up*.

<p class="centered">A shiver runs down his spine.</p>

<p class="centered">She walks away to get started on her first group.</p>

**Izumi:** (What's that girl's problem?)

<p class="centered">He sighs as he gets a call.</p>

<p class="centered">He picks it up.</p>

**Izumi:** What's up, Chloe?

**Chloe:** You forgot, didn't you?

<p class="centered">He remembers his date.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh, of course I didn't, the date, yeah.

**Chloe:** *laughs* Yeah, sure. So, where are you taking me?

**Izumi:** We can't leave the campus since you're a first-year. So, what about the one café next to the beach? Southview café, that's the one.

**Chloe:** Sure. See you there, handsome.

**Izumi:** *smiles* I'll be looking forward gorgeous.

**Chloe:** *chuckles*

<p class="centered">She cuts the call</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi stretches his arms with a smile.</p>

**Izumi:** Alright, I have nearly four hours before I need to leave. What can I do?

<p class="centered">He sees a bench and walks over to it.</p>

**Izumi:** *yawns* Let's continue with my initial plan then.

<p class="centered">He lies down and goes to sleep.</p>

<p class="centered">*A few hours later*</p>

<p class="centered">He feels a hand on his shoulder</p>

<p class="centered">He jolts awake</p>

**Izumi:** PLEASE NOT ME!

<p class="centered">Kenji hits him on the head.</p>

**Kenji:** SHUT UP!

**Izumi:** Oh, it's just you.

**Kenji:** The fuck kinda dream were you having?

**Izumi:** The one where I get kidnapped by a bunch of hot girls who take advantage of me. (He says with a scared face)

**Kenji:** Wow, horrifying. (He says sarcastically)

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles at him.</p>

**Kenji:** Aren't you getting late?

**Izumi:** Late?

**Kenji:** For the date?

**Izumi:** Which one?

<p class="centered">He looks at him with a bland expression.</p>

**Izumi:** What, you gotta be more specific.

**Kenji:** The one with the foreign chick.

**Izumi:** Oh yeah, Chloe.

**Kenji:** Yeah, that one.

**Izumi:** Chloe, Chloe.....

<p class="centered">He looks at the time and slowly realizes</p>

**Izumi:** SHIT, I'M LATE.

<p class="centered">He jumps up and gets on Kenji's motorcycle.</p>

**Kenji:** HEY, DROP ME OFF ATLEAST.

**Izumi:** Southview cafe man, it's the other way. Just walk or something, you're cutting anyways right.

**Kenji:** I already did my cardio.

<p class="centered">He starts the engine.</p>

**Izumi:** It's fine, just wait for the campus bus. I'll even send you the money afterwards.

**Kenji:** *sighs* Fine, just get her back in one piece.

**Izumi:** Of course, there wont be a single scratch.

<p class="centered">Kenji takes a seat on the bench waiting for the bus as Izumi sets off on his motorcycle.</p>

<p class="centered">*At the cafe*</p>

<p class="centered">He hurriedly parks Kenji's motorcycle, turns off the engine, and rushes towards the door.</p>

<p class="centered">He finds Chloe sitting on a table with a seat reserved for him, waving at him with a smile.</p>

<p class="centered">He catches his breath, and walks over and takes a seat.</p>

**Chloe:** So, what's with the rush? Not like I've been waiting for half an hour.

<p class="centered">He gives her a sheepish grin as he rubs his head.</p>

**Izumi:** I'm sorry, I got caught up with something urgent.

**Chloe:** Uh huh, let me guess, was it with Hitsumi?

<p class="centered">Izumi replies quickly without thinking, focused solely on a way out of his predicament.</p>

**Izumi:** Yeah... wait, what? No, that first year girl?

<p class="centered">She laughs at him getting confused.</p>

**Chloe:** Relax, I'm joking.

**Izumi:** How do you even know about her?

**Chloe:** I heard about your situation. Word travels fast around here, especially about the fest, and about you.

<p class="centered">She winks at him and he smiles.</p>

**Izumi:** You're not wrong.

**Chloe:** So, what are you planning, head volunteer?

**Izumi:** Nothing.

<p class="centered">She looks at him with a look of confusion.</p>

**Chloe:** Nothing?

**Izumi:** Yup, I never wanted this role in the first place, it was pushed on me, so I plan on doing everything I can to make the one responsible for this regret.

<p class="centered">He smiles maliciously as he thinks about Ms. Aoki.</p>

**Chloe:** You'll get a lot of heat if you go through with that.

**Izumi:** As if I don't have much now.

**Chloe:** I'm a first year, but I'm pretty knowledgeable about this university. And from what I know they take the fest pretty seriously, after all people come from even across the globe. If you sabotage it, they might not just expel you, they might even sue you.

<p class="centered">He laughs out loud at her statement. But, she responds with worry in her voice</p>

**Chloe:** I'm being serious.

**Izumi:** Don't worry, I'm a genius aren't I.

**Chloe:** So I have heard.

**Izumi:** Relax, I have it all thought out.

<p class="centered">She lets out a heavy sigh with a slight relief.</p>

**Chloe:** If you say so.

<p class="centered">After a moment of silence.</p>

**Izumi:** Have you ordered anything yet?

**Chloe:** No I wanted to order together.

**Izumi:** Have you decided what you want?

**Chloe:** Yeah, I'll have a club sandwich.

**Izumi:** Drinks?

**Chloe:** I don't know.

<p class="centered">She tries to think of something while still being hesitant of the idea.</p>

**Izumi:** Come on, I'll be paying anyways. Have something. Think of it as a treat for getting this detestable position of head volunteer.

<p class="centered">She laughs and decides to take him up on his offer.</p>

**Chloe:** Fine, I'll have a strawberry milkshake then.

**Izumi:** Nice.

**Chloe:** What about you?

**Izumi:** A cold brew.

**Chloe:** That's it? After all that talk.

**Izumi:** I'm just not hungry right now.

**Chloe:** Just get something to eat.

<p class="centered">She pokes his chest with a sly look.</p>

**Chloe:** Or you'll lose all that muscle.

**Izumi:** Alright, Alright, I'll get a sandwich too.

<p class="centered">He calls a waiter and orders everything.</p>

<p class="centered">Minutes pass as they talk about random things</p>

<p class="centered">The food arrives and they continue eating.</p>

<p class="centered">He finishes his sandwich and notices Chloe staring at his face.</p>

**Chloe:** You know, I really like your eyes.

**Izumi:** Really?

**Chloe:** Yeah, they're so... lifeless. It's like there's nothing inside, which is weird because it's normally a turn-off. But on you, it weirdly works.

**Izumi:** I appreciate the back-handed compliment.

**Chloe:** You're welcome. So, are you planning on finishing your coffee?

**Izumi:** Yeah, why?

<p class="centered">She points behind him.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi turns to see a girl approaching the table, with her arms crossed. She stands in front of him, giving him a death stare. Her presence is commanding, and her expression is filled with barely restrained fury.</p>

**???:** Sup, Izumi.

<p class="centered">He turns around slowly to look at her with a forced smile</p>

**Izumi:** Heyyy, Ria, how's it going.

<p class="centered">Chloe looks surprised.</p>

**Chloe:** Ria?

<p class="centered">Ria notices Chloe and looks at her with disgust</p>

**Ria:** So you're the unfortunate girl who's fallen for him this time.

**Chloe:** Fallen? I'm sorry, who are you.

**Ria:** I'm a server here, but you can think of me as an old friend of this poor excuse for a human being.

**Chloe:** Well, if you don't mind. This is kind of a date, so could you. ( she indicates that Ria should leave )

**Ria:** Oh, I do mind. I mind a lot actually.

<p class="centered">He laughs nervously.</p>

**Izumi:** Ria, come on, not right now.

<p class="centered">She leans forward and fixes her glare on him.</p>

**Ria:** You ghosted me.

<p class="centered">Chloe's surprise turns into shock.</p>

**Chloe:** What?

**Ria:** We dated for 3 months. Then, out of nowhere, one day he just stopped responding. No goodbye, no explanation, just nothing. Like I never existed.

<p class="centered">She clenches her fists, her voice shaking.</p>

**Ria:** And you wanna know what he did just a few weeks before cutting me off. He told me he *loved* me.

<p class="centered">Chloe's shock turns to disbelief. She looks at Izumi, silently demanding an explanation.</p>

**Chloe:** Izumi?

<p class="centered">Izumi scratches his head, avoiding both their eyes.</p>

**Izumi:** Listen, I...

<p class="centered">He trails off, unable to complete the sentence.</p>

**Ria:** Go on, explain.

<p class="centered">Chloe folds her arms, waiting. Izumi exhales sharply.</p>

**Chloe:** Please do.

**Izumi:** Well, she's a girl I used to date.

<p class="centered">She nods her head.</p>

**Chloe:** Mmm.

**Izumi:** Then ghosted.

<p class="centered">She gets up to leave.</p>

**Izumi:** Hold on.

**Chloe:** Why did you ghost her?

<p class="centered">He thinks carefully before answering.</p>

**Izumi:** ( *sighs*)

<p class="centered">He sighs internally and puts on a innocent grin.</p>

**Izumi:** I don't know.

<p class="centered">Chloe gets even angrier and moves out of her seat.</p>

**Chloe:** You know, I had a feeling you were different than what my friends made you out to be. I don't even know why. Clearly I was wrong.

**Izumi:** Wait.

<p class="centered">He reaches out to her and tries to catch her but she storms out the cafe.</p>

<p class="centered">He retracts his arm and looks down in defeat.</p>

**Izumi:** Ah, oh well.

<p class="centered">He gets up and stretches his arms and back.</p>

**Izumi:** What to do now?

<p class="centered">He overhears Ria getting scolded by her boss for yelling.</p>

**Manager:** You're gonna drive the customers away if you keep acting like that.

**Ria:** I'm sorry ma'am.

<p class="centered">He walks in and the manager switches her gaze to him.</p>

**Manager:** Great, it's you.

<p class="centered">He walks towards her in silence.</p>

**Manager:** I don't know what's your deal with this girl, but whatever it is keep it out of my joint.

<p class="centered">He stops right in front of her face and speaks to her in a low tone and with cold eyes.</p>

**Izumi:** Get out.

<p class="centered">She stammers a bit but reluctantly finds her way out filled with an unexplainable fear.</p>

**Ria:** ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME FIRED?

<p class="centered">He turns around and looks at her.</p>

**Izumi:** Hey, I was trying to help you alright?

**Ria:** By threatening my boss?

**Izumi:** You don't need this job, you're a good student.

**Ria:** Yeah, well not good enough to pay the bills.

<p class="centered">She tries to walk out to go talk to her manager but Izumi grabs her shoulder.</p>

**Izumi:** Wait.

<p class="centered">She turns around hesitantly.</p>

**Ria:** What?

**Izumi:** Listen to me, I'm really sorry for what I did. I know there's no excuse, so I'm not gonna give one. While I hope you can forgive me, I understand if you can't. But we're still friends, so if you want money you can just ask me.

**Ria:** Really, if you're such a good friend then why did you not reply to the dozens of missed calls I gave.

<p class="centered">He looks to the side without an answer.</p>

**Ria:** Or the hundreds of texts, or the letters. I can't even believe it, I sent you letters.

<p class="centered">She starts to spiral out slowly in an emotional fit.</p>

**Izumi:** I said I was a friend, never a good one.

<p class="centered">She gets pissed off and turns to leave once again with her hands curled into a fist holding her rage back.</p>

**Izumi:** Hold on.

<p class="centered">She stops in her tracks and he walks towards her.</p>

**Izumi:** I do really like you. I mean it. You didn't do anything wrong, in fact you were perfect. Any guy would be lucky to have you.

<p class="centered">For a second her false bravado falls apart and she turns around, runs into his arms and hugs him with tears running down her face.</p>

**Ria:** THEN WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME HUH? TELL ME?

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles gently and brushes her head.</p>

**Izumi:** I'm sorry.

<p class="centered">She takes a step back and looks at him face to face.</p>

**Ria:** No, no apologies, tell me why.

<p class="centered">He looks down not knowing how to answer.</p>

**Ria:** Actually you know what, fine keep your secrets. It's probably better if I don't know, right?

<p class="centered">He smiles and nods his head slowly</p>

<p class="centered">She sighs and rubs the tears off her face.</p>

**Ria:** Fine, so... friends?

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles and offers her a handshake.</p>

<p class="centered">She puffs her face and hugs him instead and he hugs her back.</p>

<p class="centered">He let's out a laugh and she gets annoyed.</p>

**Ria:** What?

**Izumi:** Nothing?

<p class="centered">She looks at him for a moment and they start laughing together.</p>

<p class="centered">After their laughter calms down they start catching up/</p>

**Izumi:** So, how have you been.

**Ria:** Not the best as you can see, but I'm making do with what I have.

**Izumi:** I did mean what I said, if you want money just ask.

**Ria:** Yeah, yeah, not need to brag.

**Izumi:** *laughs* I'm serious.

**Ria:** *laughs* What about you? It seems your back to your usual hobbies.

<p class="centered">She says insinuating his date with Chloe.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh that, well that's as good as over.

**Rin:** Why? What happened?

**Izumi:** I'd rather not get into it.

**Rin:** Fine, it's not like you have a lack of females anyways.

<p class="centered">He scratched his head sheepishly, sticking his tongue out in a playful tease.</p>

<p class="centered">Suddenly, he gets a notification on his phone and he pulls it out to check it.</p>

**Rin:** Which damsel is in distress now?

<p class="centered">He looks at his phone with a smile, but slowly his smile turns into a sluggish and irritated pout.</p>

**Rin:** What happened? Who is it?

**Izumi:** No one of concern.

<p class="centered">She folds her arms and stares at him.</p>

**Izumi:** Argh, fine, it's the assistant head volunteer.

**Rin:** Of the fest? What do they have to do with you.

**Izumi:** Well, maybe because she *my* assistant volunteer.

<p class="centered">She nods her head as a sign of understanding.</p>

**Rin:** Oh, yeah, wait.

<p class="centered">She realizes what that means.</p>

**Rin:** YOU'RE THE HEAD VOLUNTEER OF THE FEST.

<p class="centered">He let's out a sigh with a mix of laziness and frustration</p>

**Izumi:** Yes.

**Rin:** How come I didn't know?

**Izumi:** It was just decided today, so I'm guessing it will be public by tomorrow.

**Rin:** I can't wait for the fest.

<p class="centered">She gives a evil smile knowing the Izumi's misery.</p>

**Izumi:** Sure.

<p class="centered">He slumps his shoulder, and looks at the message.</p>

**Hitsumi:** "How far along are you?"

<p class="centered">He renames her contact and puts the phone back leaving her on read.</p>

**Rin:** What is she checking in about.

**Izumi:** I was supposed to ask 5 clubs or groups of people trying to host something during the fest, what exactly they were planning to do.

**Rin:** That doesn't sound like something you'd be up to do.

**Izumi:** You're right, that's why I pawned it off to 5 girls.

<p class="centered">He gives her a gleeful smile and she responds with a look of disgust.</p>

**Izumi:** What?

**Rin:** You should really try to do somethings yourself.

**Izumi:** Now you're starting to sound like her.

**Rin:** Sure, just don't get into any trouble.

**Izumi:** Alright, see you later.

<p class="centered">He gives her a hug and walks towards the exit.</p>

**Rin:** Izumi.

<p class="centered">He looks over his shoulders.</p>

**Izumi:** Yeah?

**Rin:** Take care.

<p class="centered">She says with a smile and a little bit of a blush.</p>

<p class="centered">He turns around hiding his smile and raises and waves his hand.</p>

**Izumi:** You too.

<p class="centered">*Outside*</p>

<p class="centered">He exits the café and looks at the sun setting over the horizon.</p>

**Izumi:** (It's getting pretty late, how come none of the girls have texted me yet)

<p class="centered">He walks over to Kenji's motorcycle and starts the engine; taking a seat.</p>

**Izumi:** (Something's not right. They should be jumping at the opportunity to message me)

<p class="centered">He ponders for sometime looking ahead.</p>

**Izumi:** (Oh well, I'm probably just overthinking)

<p class="centered">As he is about to shift gears and start moving he gets a notification.</p>

<p class="centered">**Unknown: 1 text**</p>

<p class="centered">He looks at the profile picture and remembers it's one of the girls from the 5</p>

**Izumi:** Finally.

<p class="centered">He smiles and unlocks his phone to look at the text.</p>

<p class="centered">But his look turns from happiness to dread.</p>

**Unknown:** "Izumi"

<p class="centered">He stared at his phone, his breath hitching as his mouth fell open.</p>

<p class="centered">His phone shakes from his lack of grip as his hand shudders.</p>

**Unknown:** "Help us."

<p class="centered">The shock died instantly. His jaw clamped shut, his mouth flattening into a cold line and his hair hides his eyes as his arms drop loose still holding onto the phone.</p>

**Unknown:** "Please"
