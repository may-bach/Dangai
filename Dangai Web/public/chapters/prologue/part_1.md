<p class="centered">The room was dim, illuminated only by the flickering blue light of a cheap television buzzing in the corner. The air smelled of stale cigarettes and damp plaster. On the screen, a polished advertisement played, the volume turned up just loud enough to distort the speakers.</p>

<p class="centered">A Television advertisement plays.</p>

<p class="centered">"Kansai University, standing right in the middle of Osaka like a massive fortress is a University operating more like a private metropolis than a school. The scale is breathtaking; wide avenues wind through the district, filled with cars cruising past high-end shopping malls, multiplex cinemas, and 5-star restaurants. It is a self-contained paradise that features sprawling parks and private beaches, ensuring no one ever has a reason to leave."</p>

<p class="centered">The narration takes a darker tone.</p>

<p class="centered">"However, beneath the luxury lies a strict, merit-based hierarchy. In this world, talent is monetized. Students earn their living not just through exams, but by excelling in sports, music, and the arts. While the academic blocks are gleaming towers of glass, the mandatory residential zones reveal the reality of the system. Housing is assigned solely based on performance, ranging from luxurious, hotel-like suites for the elite to cramped, shared dormitories for those at the bottom. Here, grades and achievements are the only currency that matters, creating a dazzling but ruthless golden cage for the country's best and brightest."</p>

<p class="centered">A baseball sailed through the open window, shattering the TV screen in an explosion of sparks and plastic. The ad cut out instantly, replaced by the hiss of static.</p>

<p class="centered">The man watching the TV gets up in anger and goes to the window and sees a bunch of kids asking for the ball back.</p>

<p class="centered">Out of anger he goes back in and hurls the ball at them at full force but misses.</p>

<p class="centered">The kids laugh as the ball hits the pavement with a hollow thwack, bouncing high.</p>

<p class="centered">Scene transition from that ball to another.</p>

<p class="centered">A guy lies on the floor with his left arm covering his eyes and playing with a ball with his right.</p>

<p class="centered">He idly tossed the ball up and caught it as he slept underneath a bridge.</p>

<p class="centered">He has his earbuds plugged in as he talks to his friend on the phone</p>

<p class="centered">He throws the ball up and catches it before throwing it up again.</p>

**Friend:** The classes are about to start, man, it's the first class of the year.

<p class="centered">The guy responds without stopping the ball</p>

**???:** Man, chill out. This is our second year, you should know the teacher doesn't care.

<p class="centered">The teacher yells over Kenji's phone</p>

**Teacher:** KENJI, PUT DOWN THE PHONE.

**Kenji (Friend):** I think this one cares a bit.

<p class="centered">He looks up at the teacher.</p>

**Kenji:** Just a minute, teach, it's my father. It's really important.

**???:** *smiles* You can call me daddy anytime, man.

**Kenji:** COME TO CLASS.

<p class="centered">He gets up and starts bouncing the ball off the wall catching it on the rebound as he dusts his pants.</p>

**???:** You really gotta try harder to convince me to attend a Calculus class at 8 on a Monday morning.

<p class="centered">Kenji takes a breath and calms down.</p>

**Kenji:** You remember how this time, first and second years have the same class for math.

**???:** Yeah?

**Kenji:** *clears his throat* The first year, girls are hot.

<p class="centered">The rhythmic bouncing stopped. The ball landed on the floor with a dull thud, rolling away into an empty corridor as the boy vanished.</p>

<p class="centered">The students walking in the corridor scatter as the guy runs while barely grabbing onto his messenger bag</p>

**???:** You should've told me sooner, man.

**Kenji:** Yeah, you're right, maybe I should've. Make your way to class quickly.

<p class="centered">He cuts the call, and Izumi smiles, and he speeds up</p>

<p class="centered">He shoved his phone into his pocket, picking up speed. He overtook a group of friends and slammed shoulder-first into a girl too short for him to notice instantly walking in the opposite direction. The impact was solid, hitting her right on the head, almost sending her falling. He turns around momentarily to apologize.</p>

<p class="centered">She glares at him furiously with her hand on her head, and he could predict the situation that would unfold.</p>

**Purple-eyed Girl:** DO YOU NOT PAY ATTENTION TO -

<p class="centered">Not wanting to listen to her argue, he ignores her, turns back and continues running.</p>

**Purple-eyed Girl:** HEY, COME BACK HERE.

<p class="centered">He ignored her, skidding up to his classroom door. He grabbed the doorframe, using his momentum to swing himself inside, and halted dramatically in the entrance.</p>

**Teacher:** And who are you?

**???:** A student of this class?

**Teacher:** Great, another smart ass. Come here and show your name in the register.

<p class="centered">He walked to the desk, giving a little two-finger salute to Kenji in the back row.</p>

<p class="centered">He ran his finger down the attendance sheet.</p>

**???:** Anddd, there.

**Teacher:** Kurosaki Izumi?

**Izumi (???):** That's me.

**Teacher:** You're that Kurosaki.

**Izumi:** I'm not really sure what that means, but I'm inclined to say yes.

**Teacher:** *exhales deeply* Why do I always get these students?! I just wanna earn enough to support my family.

<p class="centered">Izumi stands there, in confusion.</p>

**Izumi:** What did you say?

**Teacher:** Just go take a seat, and please don't ask any doubts.

**Izumi:** Don't worry, I don't plan on it.

<p class="centered">He turned to the class, his eyes scanning the room like a predator looking for... well, not prey, but entertainment.</p>

**Teacher:** Alright, class, settle down.

<p class="centered">He strolled to the back row, dropped his bag next to Kenji, and sat down, immediately propping his legs up on the desk.</p>

**Kenji:** What do you think?

**Izumi:** The two on the left are good, and so is the one in the first row. But I'm more interested in the two rows in front of us.

**Kenji:** Oh, I heard she's a rich girl, daddy's princess type shit.

**Izumi:** *grins* I like a challenge.

<p class="centered">Izumi leaned forward and tapped the shoulder of the guy in front of him.</p>

**Izumi:** Move over.

<p class="centered">The guy glances back, annoyed</p>

**Guy:** I'm trying to—

**Izumi:** Thanks.

<p class="centered">He stands on his desk. Kenji's eyes widen.</p>

**Kenji:** (whispered) Dude, what are you—

<p class="centered">With a burst of agility, Izumi vaulted forward, landing on the next desk with a loud thud. The guy sitting there jerked back.</p>

**Guy:** What the hell?

<p class="centered">Izumi ignored him, performing a side-vault over that table and landing smoothly in the empty seat beside Chloe.</p>

<p class="centered">He put his arm around her and smiled.</p>

**Izumi:** Hey, how are you?

**???:** *smirks* I know what you're about, my friend's a senior, she's told me a lot about you.

**Izumi:** Whoa, so you've done your research.

**???:** You could say that.

**Izumi:** So what's Ms. Pretty's name?

**Chloe (???):** It's Chloe.

**Izumi:** Oh, you're not from here?

**Chloe:** What gave it away, the blonde hair or the accent?

**Izumi:** *smiles* What about those pretty blue eyes?

**Chloe:** *laughs* I'm from the US.

**Izumi:** Whoa, American, that's pretty exotic.

**Chloe:** I'll take that as a compliment.

<p class="centered">Chloe laughs</p>

**Izumi:** So, since you're new, I was thinking I could offer to take some time out of my busy day to give you a tour of the place.

**Chloe:** Wow, really. That's very generous, but as I said, my friend, a senior, can give me the tour.

**Izumi:** Oh, are you sure? I know a lot about the university that even your friend wouldn't know.

**Chloe:** Yeah, I'm sure. I already made plans with her.

**Izumi:** *sighs and smiles* Well, you win some, you lose some.

<p class="centered">He retracted his arm and coiled his muscles to jump back.</p>

<p class="centered">But just as he moved, she grabbed his wrist.</p>

**Chloe:** Wait.

**Izumi:** Hmm?

**Chloe:** I didn't hear the best things about you, but you seem like a nice guy. What about after she gives me a tour, we can grab coffee.

**Izumi:** *smirks* Of course, there's this really good coffee place I know downtown.

**Chloe:** Great.

<p class="centered">She slides him a paper with her number</p>

**Izumi:** Perfect, I'll pick you up.

<p class="centered">She let go of his arm with a smile. Izumi launched himself backward, clearing the desk and landing on the table behind him. The student occupying it scrambled to the right to avoid being crushed. Izumi did a final backflip into his original seat, landing perfectly and throwing his legs back onto the desk.</p>

<p class="centered">The teacher notices everything and decides to ignore it.</p>

**Teacher:** I hate my life.

<p class="centered">He continues writing formulae on the board.</p>

**Kenji:** So?

<p class="centered">Izumi shows him the paper and smiles without turning his head.</p>

**Kenji:** Nicee. That was easier than I expected.

**Izumi:** Yeah, her friend tried to make it harder for me, but she just ended up helping me.

**Kenji:** How?

**Izumi:** If you tell a girl like that not to do something, she's just going to wanna do it more.

<p class="centered">He explains as he lies back.</p>

**Kenji:** Who's her friend?

**Izumi:** Who knows? Probably some other girls I used to talk to.

<p class="centered">He slowly closes his eyes and begins to sleep.</p>

**Kenji:** You're just gonna go back to sleep.

**Izumi:** I was about to when you called me, just continuing the job I left off.

**Kenji:** Alright, I'll wake you up after the class is over.

<p class="centered">Izumi shows a thumbs up, leans on the chair, and goes back to sleep.</p>

<p class="centered">The bell rings and all the students leave the class.</p>

**Teacher:** Alright, guys, we'll continue where we-

<p class="centered">Before he could finish, he realized almost all the students had left the class, and looked down, depressed.</p>

**Teacher:** I hate my job.

<p class="centered">He shuffled out, leaving only Kenji and the sleeping Izumi. Kenji nudged his friend. He nudges him, but he refuses to wake up.</p>

**Kenji:** Hey, man, the next class students are gonna start coming any second now, wake up. Our next class is two blocks away.

<p class="centered">Izumi groaned burying his face</p>

**Izumi:** What? Why?

**Kenji:** The first years have some kind of orientation in this class now. So, for the rest of the day, our classes are shifted.

<p class="centered">Izumi pushes him away and turns to his side</p>

**Izumi:** 10 more minutes. Besides, there might be some cute girls.

<p class="centered">Kenji accepts defeat and leaves the room as the next class of students starts entering.</p>

**Kenji:** Fine, suit yourself, don't say I didn't try.

<p class="centered">As he makes his exit, the students start filling the benches except the one he is sitting on.</p>

<p class="centered">All seven rows get filled with two students in each table, except the last row towards the window, occupied by Izumi.</p>

<p class="centered">The next teacher walks in, and all the students stand up to greet her.</p>

**Students:** Good morning, Madam.

**Teacher:** Take a seat. I'm Ms. Aoki. I'm the HOD of Computer Science engineering, and I'll also be your handler, I guess you could say, as long as you're here in this university. I hope we can get along.

<p class="centered">She starts pacing around the front of the class.</p>

**Aoki:** Today, I'll be giving you a brief rundown of how things work in this university.

<p class="centered">The studious students in the front row take out books to note down what she says, while the students a bit farther behind talk amongst themselves.</p>

<p class="centered">Meanwhile, Izumi continued to sleep in the last row completely undisturbed.</p>

<p class="centered">Thirty minutes passed. As Ms. Aoki was wrapping up her speech, her sharp eyes caught movement—or rather, a lack of it—in the eighth row.</p>

**Aoki:** Excuse me, you're in the back.

<p class="centered">Izumi continues to snore without a care in the world.</p>

**Aoki:** HEY, YOU IN THE LAST.

**Izumi:** *snores*.

<p class="centered">Ms. Aoki's eye twitched. With perfect bowling form, she snatched a whiteboard marker from the tray and hurled it. It was a precision strike, flying straight toward Izumi's head with dangerous speed.</p>

**Student 1:** She must be a baseball fan.

<p class="centered">The marker streaked through the air. Inches before impact, Izumi's hand shot up. Without opening his eyes, without lifting his head, he caught the marker out of the air with a sharp snap.</p>

<p class="centered">He woke up slowly, yawning and rubbing his eyes with his free hand. He looked at the marker, then at the front of the room.</p>

**Izumi:** Teach, I think you dropped this.

<p class="centered">The class erupted in laughter. Izumi looked around, confused, until his eyes locked with Ms. Aoki's furious glare.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh.

**Aoki:** Did you even listen to a word I said?

**Izumi:** Umm.

**Aoki:** Of course, you didn't.

<p class="centered">She looks at the rest of the class.</p>

**Aoki:** For the rest of you, don't be like this guy, or you'll end up failing your first year here.

<p class="centered">The class laughed again. Izumi chuckled along with them.</p>

**Aoki:** Why are you laughing?

**Izumi:** Oh, sorry.

**Aoki:** Why did you come to this university? This is quite a prestigious university. How did you even get in? Daddy's money?

<p class="centered">Leaning back in confidence he flashes a smirk.</p>

**Izumi:** Well, I'd have you know I did get in by merit. As for your first question, I came here cause I heard this place has the hottest girls.

<p class="centered">Silence. Then, chaos. The class roared with laughter. Aoki did not smile.</p>

**Aoki:** WHAT'S YOUR NAME!

**Izumi:** *grins* Kurosaki, Izumi Kurosaki.

**Aoki:** Wait, I've heard that name before.

<p class="centered">All the students start murmuring amongst themselves, realizing who he is.</p>

**Aoki:** You're that second-year delinquent. Why are you here? This class is for first years.

**Izumi:** Umm.

<p class="centered">Before she could lay into him again, the bell rang.</p>

**Aoki:** *exhales*You, meet me outside. As for the rest of you, stay here; the next teacher will give you a more in-depth analysis of the academic structure of the university.

<p class="centered">She points to him again and signals him to come out.</p>

<p class="centered">He sighs and starts packing his bag.</p>

<p class="centered">Meanwhile.</p>

<p class="centered">A girl sitting in the first row plays with her pen.</p>

<p class="centered">She looks around her and notices everyone talking about him.</p>

<p class="centered">She takes an interest in his character but doesn't turn around to look at him.</p>

**???:** (Interesting, everyone seems to know who he is. I mean, I shouldn't be surprised, I never really do a whole lot of research into the students. )

<p class="centered">She asks the girl next to her about him</p>

**???:** Hey, who is he?

**Neighbor Girl:** You don't know?

<p class="centered">She looks at her with a straight face.</p>

**Neighbor Girl:** Fair enough, stupid question. That's Izumi. He got perfect scores in every subject in his midterms but barely passed his finals.

**???:** How?

**Neighbor Girl:** I don't know, they say he does it on purpose cause he doesn't wanna stand out.

**???:** Well, clearly whatever he's doing isn't working.

<p class="centered">As Izumi walked down the aisle toward the exit, girls began to wave and scream his name. He smiled and waved back like a celebrity on a red carpet.</p>

**Neighbor Girl:** I guess he's more well-known for talking to every girl he finds cute.

**???:** So a Playboy?

**Neighbor Girl:** You could say that.

**???:** Great (sarcastically).

**Neighbor Girl:** Yeah, I don't really like him.

**???:** Uh huh.

<p class="centered">As Izumi approaches the first row, even the girl starts screaming.</p>

**Neighbor Girl:** HIII IZUMI.

**???:** *sighs* so much for not liking him.

<p class="centered">The girl smiles at her awkwardly.</p>

<p class="centered">She rolls her eyes and slowly turns around to look at him</p>

**???:** Just who is this guy?

<p class="centered">As Izumi walks past her bench to the exit, she turns back and they look at each other.</p>

**Izumi:** Have we met before?

<p class="centered">He thinks back and realizes that he had seen these eyes earlier that day.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh.

**Purple-eyed Girl (???):** Wait, you are…

<p class="centered">She realizes as well.</p>

<p class="centered">He smiles innocently as he rubs his neck.</p>

**Izumi:** (Shit ).
