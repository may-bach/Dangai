
**Izumi:** Heyyy…

**???:** YOU ARE THE GUY WHO RAN INTO ME EARLIER AREN'T YOU.

**Izumi:** Umm. I don't know. Maybe you're mistaking me for someone else?

**???:** You have the same outfit.

<p class="centered">He looks at his black jacket he wore on top of a white tee.</p>

**Izumi:** A lot of people have this jacket.

<p class="centered">They look around and notice no one having anything similar. She turns back towards him.</p>

**Izumi:** Well…

<p class="centered">She gets pissed off and grabs him by his collar.</p>

**Izumi:** Woah, woah, woah. Chill out.

**???:** Chill out? You didn't even apologize.

**Izumi:** It's not my fault you sounded so annoying. *he says looking away from her*

**???:** EXCUSE ME?

<p class="centered">She gets even more frustrated and tightens her grip. The students around start whispering to each other about what's going on.</p>

**Girl:** *whispers* Hey, put him down.

<p class="centered">She ignores her. As this is going on a voice is heard from outside.</p>

**Aoki:** KUROSAKI!

<p class="centered">He turns back towards the girl grabbing his shirt.</p>

**Izumi:** You heard the teacher.

<p class="centered">He shakes her off and escapes to the door.</p>

**???:** Hey, I'm not done with you.

<p class="centered">He ignores her and runs away waving goodbye.</p>

**Izumi:** Talk to you later… or maybe not, hopefully.

**???:** Hey, wait.

<p class="centered">Izumi runs out and she chases after him, but before she could leave the next teacher enters. He notices Izumi and lets him pass so that he wouldn't have to deal with him.</p>

**Teacher:** NO RUNNING IN THE CLASS KUROSAKI.

<p class="centered">The same couldn't be said for her.</p>

**Teacher:** And where do you think you're going miss?

**???:** Why did you let him leave?

**Teacher:** He's a second year, it's beyond me why he was here to begin with, but frankly I don't care.

**???:** But, that boy.

**Teacher:** Alright alright settle down Ms. Miyamoto, you can talk to your boyfriend later, right now it's my class.

**???:** WHAT! HE'S NOT MY…

<p class="centered">She looks over his shoulder and notices he's completely missing.</p>

**???:** *sighs* Whatever. *(I'll get him eventually)*

<p class="centered">She goes back and takes a seat, controlling her fury.</p>

**Teacher:** Alright class, I'm Tanaka, you shall refer to me as Mr. Tanaka.

<p class="centered">A guy stands up from the back.</p>

**Student:** No first name?

**Tanaka:** What are you to call me, Mr. Yuno?

**Yuno:** How do you know my name?

**Tanaka:** I know the name and face of every student in this college. Including first years.

**Yuno:** What? *in disbelief*

**Tanaka:** You heard me.

**Yuno:** Well, Mr. Tanaka?

**Tanaka:** Is my first name mentioned there somewhere?

**Yuno:** No.

**Tanaka:** Then there is no reason for you to know it.

**Yuno:** But—

**Tanaka:** Yes?

**Yuno:** Nothing, never mind.

**Tanaka:** Good.

<p class="centered">The student sits down in defeat.</p>

**Tanaka:** Now, I'm your university's academic dean. I will be talking in detail about the academic syllabus of this university, which you better pay attention to unless you want to end up kicked out due to academic insufficiency—

<p class="centered">He points towards the door.</p>

**Tanaka:** Or end up like that guy, which you definitely don't want to.

<p class="centered">A student turns to his friend.</p>

**Student:** I don't know man, sounds like he has a pretty good life.

<p class="centered">The teacher notices.</p>

**Tanaka:** Something bothering you Mr. Jine?

**Jine:** *flustered* Oh nothing, sorry.

<p class="centered">The teacher gives him an indifferent look and continues his lecture.</p>

**Teacher:** Alright, First…

<p class="centered">The girl goes back to spinning her pen out of boredom as she is no longer interested in the class, but in how to get back at Izumi.</p>

<p class="centered">Outside the class.</p>

**Aoki:** Kurosaki, what took you so long?

**Izumi:** *exhales* Girl troubles.

**Aoki:** *rolls her eyes* Of course. What's your deal Izumi?

**Izumi:** *smirks* First name basis?

<p class="centered">She looks at him with a bland expression.</p>

**Izumi:** Sorry, force of habit.

<p class="centered">She sighs with a lack of surprise.</p>

**Izumi:** I'm just here for fun.

**Aoki:** This is no place someone who's just "here for fun" can make it into.

<p class="centered">As he is about to respond she cuts him off.</p>

**Aoki:** This is my first year as the HOD and the thing I was most advised about wasn't how to manage finances or academic deadlines. It was to not get involved with you.

**Izumi:** *smiles* I didn't know my notoriety was that high.

<p class="centered">She starts walking and Izumi follows her.</p>

**Aoki:** I went through your entrance exams. You got exactly 86 out of 100 marks.

**Izumi:** Seems normal enough.

**Aoki:** Yes, except that was the exact cutoff mark for entering. One mark lower and you wouldn't have gotten a seat.

**Izumi:** Really? Phew, that was close huh.

**Aoki:** You had to have gotten 93 right and the other 7 wrong so that the negative marks would bring your total to 86.

**Izumi:** 93 – 7 is 86.

**Aoki:** Except, you got the first 93 correct without missing a single one, and somehow got the last 7 wrong in a row.

**Izumi:** *surprised* What? I thought teachers didn't have access to the answer sheets.

**Aoki:** *ignores him* And might I add, you answered the 94th question right then proceeded to strike it out and choose the wrong one.

**Izumi:** That does look quite suspicious huh.

**Aoki:** It does.

**Izumi:** What a coincidence?

<p class="centered">She looks at him suspiciously.</p>

**Izumi:** What?

**Aoki:** *sighs* Fine, keep your secrets. I don't know what you're planning to do with your life. But it's none of my concern either. But if you take too many risks to mask your intelligence for whatever reason, you might end up in a situation you may come to regret.

**Izumi:** *smiles* Don't worry I don't make mistakes.

<p class="centered">He turns around and starts to walk away. She extends her arm backwards and grabs him by the back of his collar without turning around.</p>

**Izumi:** HEY, WHAT GIVES?

**Aoki:** I never said I was done with you.

<p class="centered">He escapes her grasp and turns around; continuing to walk with her.</p>

**Izumi:** What more do you want? You're not even my teacher.

**Aoki:** That's irrelevant, I'm the HOD, which means I'm still responsible for you.

**Izumi:** *sighs* Fine.

**Aoki:** Good. Are you aware of the fest coming up?

**Izumi:** Sure, I am. I can't wait.

**Aoki:** Really, and what makes you look forward to it so much?

<p class="centered">He keeps his finger on his chin and smiles slyly.</p>

**Izumi:** Girls from other universities.

<p class="centered">She hits him on the head.</p>

**Izumi:** OW, hey you can't hit me.

**Aoki:** Hit? Who hit who?

<p class="centered">He realizes she's just gonna deny it happening and gives up arguing.</p>

**Aoki:** *smiles* Well, as the HOD of the most successful department in the university, I've been appointed as the Chief Coordinator of the fest.

**Izumi:** Congratulations. Does that come with a bonus? *grins*

**Aoki:** I don't think that's any of your business Kurosaki.

<p class="centered">He crosses his arms and looks away in disappointment.</p>

**Aoki:** *smiles* And as the chief I have a lot of responsibilities.

**Izumi:** I'm sure you do. But, what does this have to do with me?

**Aoki:** One of the responsibilities happens to be choosing volunteers for the fest.

**Izumi:** You mean glorified peons.

**Aoki:** That's one way to put it.

**Izumi:** Sure, I can help you with that. I know a couple girls who would love to do things like that.

**Aoki:** You misunderstand me.

<p class="centered">Izumi realizes where she's going with this, but continues to act in the hopes that he's wrong.</p>

**Izumi:** What do you mean?

**Aoki:** *smirks* You know exactly what I mean.

**Izumi:** Nope, No, Nah, Nein, Nada. Not happening. Nuh uh. Never.

**Aoki:** I wasn't asking Kurosaki.

**Izumi:** I'm not gonna be the university's slave.

**Aoki:** Well then, you'll be pleased to know that in your own words, you won't be a slave.

**Izumi:** *he has a sigh of relief* Phew, thanks teach. I always knew you were a good one.

**Aoki:** You are gonna be the head slave.

**Izumi:** WHAT?

**Aoki:** I hope you're happy with your posting, head volunteer.

**Izumi:** I'm busy, I can't do this. I'm not responsible at all. I have no sense of direction. I will also be sick on that day, so I can't possibly do my job well.

<p class="centered">They make their way to the chairman's office as Izumi comes with more and more unique reasons. Uninterested in his statements, she raises her hand to cover his face and grabs the office door's handle with her other hand.</p>

**Aoki:** I'm not interested in your excuses Kurosaki. I will call you to meet me later at my office, right now I have an important meeting to attend to. All the best, head volunteer. *smiles*

**Izumi:** But I—

<p class="centered">He reaches his hand out, but before he could finish she goes in and slams the door shut and he retracts his hand in defeat.</p>

**Chairman:** What's the problem Ms. Aoki? What took you so long?

**Aoki:** Oh Nothing Sir. Just student problems.

**Chairman:** Oh, how are the freshers for the batch you met?

**Aoki:** Not bad.

**Chairman:** And how are the preparations for the fest coming along?

**Aoki:** *smiles as she thinks about Izumi* Great.

**Chairman:** That's good to hear. Remember, this is the 50th fest. So it has to be the best one so far.

**Aoki:** Don't worry Chairman. I can promise you this will be the best. *smiles* I have a good feeling about this.

<p class="centered">Meanwhile, Izumi takes a walk down the corridor with his hands in his pockets as he contemplates about the fest. Her words echo in his head.</p>

**Aoki:** *(All the best head volunteer)*

<p class="centered">He exhales and throws his head up towards the sky.</p>

**Izumi:** Agh, what's her problem?

<p class="centered">As he's walking a paper ball hits him from the left. He turns around annoyed and sees a group of kids with paper balls as a guy sitting in the middle juggles a ball. Izumi decides to ignore them, he turns and continues walking. As soon as he turns another paper ball hits his head as the group laughs. This time he was mildly more annoyed but still decides to proceed with his day. Unfortunately, they weren't having it. One of the guys steps in front of him and blocks his path. The guy from the center calls out to Izumi.</p>

**Bully:** Hey, Pipsqueak.

<p class="centered">He turns around to look at him, uninterested. The bully walks up to him.</p>

**Bully:** Can't you see where you're going? *he says as he signals to his friend in front of Izumi*

**Izumi:** Alright, my bad, sorry guys.

<p class="centered">He tries to squeeze past them, but the bully joins with his friend and blocks him.</p>

**Bully:** I'm afraid an apology isn't gonna be enough.

<p class="centered">He says with a smile as he cracks his knuckles.</p>

**Izumi:** *smiles* Of course.

<p class="centered">He takes out his wallet and gives them all his money. The bully smacks it out of his hand.</p>

**Bully:** You think we're thugs, we don't want your money.

<p class="centered">As he says that, one of his guys in the background scramble to pick up all the money. The bully looks at them mad as Izumi chuckles.</p>

**Bully:** What's so funny?

**Izumi:** Nothing.

<p class="centered">The bully grabs him by his collar.</p>

**Bully:** *grits his teeth* Watch your mouth bastard.

**Izumi:** First year?

**Bully:** What about it, aren't you as well?

**Izumi:** Nah, I'm a second year. *smiles* *(Of course he is)*

<p class="centered">All of them start laughing.</p>

**???:** A second year getting bullied by a first year.

**Bully:** *laughs* Come on guys show him some respect, he's our senior.

**Izumi:** So like, can I go now?

**Bully:** No, you still haven't given me what I want.

**Izumi:** Oh, and what is that?

**Bully:** *smiles* Fear.

**Izumi:** Excuse me?

<p class="centered">He lets go of his collar.</p>

**Bully:** Get down on your knees.

**Izumi:** Kinda gay man.

**Bully:** I'm not playing with you pipsqueak.

<p class="centered">He says as he shoves him and looks down on him. (He is about 6' 2 and Izumi is 5' 10)</p>

**Bully:** Fall down at my feet.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks down and covers his face.</p>

**Bully:** Hiding in fear?

<p class="centered">As the bully walks towards him someone calls him from behind.</p>

**???:** HARUTO.

<p class="centered">He turns around to see another guy with his own group, with more mature looking students.</p>

**Haruto:** Brother?

<p class="centered">One of Haruto's guys looks at the guy in awe.</p>

**??? 1:** Isn't that Nanjo Yusei?

**??? 2:** Yeah. He is a third year, he is like the gang leader around here.

**??? 1:** I heard he's never lost a fight.

**??? 2:** Yeah.

**??? 3:** Except the one time he did.

**??? 1:** Yusei lost?

**??? 2:** Oh, yeah I've heard about it.

**??? 1:** What happened?

**??? 3:** One guy beat him up, not just him, his entire gang.

**??? 1:** WHAT? *he whispers*

**??? 2:** It's true, the guy was an absolute demon.

**??? 1:** Who was he?

**??? 2:** It's… I can't remember.

**??? 1:** How can you forget something like that?

**??? 2:** My memory was never the strongest ok.

<p class="centered">Yusei walks over to Haruto.</p>

**Yusei:** Leave him alone.

**Haruto:** Who, this bitch?

**Yusei:** Let. Him. Go. *he says seriously*

**Haruto:** *gnashes his teeth* Fine. Scram, before I change my mind.

<p class="centered">Izumi lifts his head finally, and flashes a smile, before escaping.</p>

**Izumi:** Phew, Thank you Yusei, I owe you one.

<p class="centered">He runs down the hallway and turns at the corridor out of sight.</p>

**Haruto:** You know who he is?

**Yusei:** Of course I know who he is. How do you not?

**??? 2:** Oh wait, I just got his name.

**Haruto:** Am I supposed to?

**Yusei:** Yes, you're supposed to.

<p class="centered">Yusei looks at the direction he went angrily.</p>

**Yusei:** That's Kurosaki Izumi.

**??? 2:** His name is… *he hears what Yusei says* WHAT.

**??? 1:** What, What happened?

**??? 2:** H-h-hi-his name is, K-Ku-Kurosaki… Izumi.

**??? 1:** Oh, wait, so that guy was.

**??? 2:** Yeah, that was him. *he says borderline speechlessly*

**??? 1:** WHAT.

**Haruto:** WHAT? That's Izumi?

**Yusei:** Yes.

**Haruto:** But he was scared shitless of me, he was even looking down trying to hide his face in fear.

**Yusei:** He wasn't hiding anything. He doesn't feel fear.

<p class="centered">He remembers his face right then, and has flashbacks of his face from the fight last year.</p>

**Yusei:** He was trying to hide his smile.

**Haruto:** What?

<p class="centered">He looks in disbelief at where Izumi went.</p>

**Haruto:** Who the hell is that guy, or rather what is he?
