**Izumi:** Heyyy...

**White-haired Girl:** YOU ARE THE GUY WHO RAN INTO ME EARLIER, AREN'T YOU?

**Izumi:** Umm. I don't know. Maybe you're mistaking me for someone else?

**White-haired Girl:** You have the same outfit.

<p class="centered">He looks at his black jacket he wore on top of a white tee.</p>

**Izumi:** A lot of people have this jacket.

<p class="centered">They look around and notice no one has anything similar.</p>

<p class="centered">She turns back towards him.</p>

**Izumi:** Well...

<p class="centered">She gets pissed off and grabs him by his collar</p>

**Izumi:** Whoa, whoa, whoa. Chill out.

**White-haired Girl:** Chill out? You didn't even apologize.

**Izumi:** It's not my fault you sounded so annoying.

<p class="centered">He says it while looking away from her, completely dismissing the threat.</p>

**White-haired Girl:** EXCUSE ME?

<p class="centered">She gets even more frustrated and tightens her grip on his collar. The students around them start whispering, eyes darting between the fuming girl and the nonchalant boy.</p>

**Neighbor Girl:** *whispers* Hey, put him down.

<p class="centered">She ignores her</p>

<p class="centered">As the tension peaks, a voice cuts through from outside the classroom.</p>

**Aoki:** KUROSAKI!

<p class="centered">He turns back towards the girl, grabbing his shirt</p>

**Izumi:** You heard the teacher.

<p class="centered">He shakes her off and escapes toward the door.</p>

**White-haired Girl:** Hey, I'm not done with you.

<p class="centered">He ignores her and runs away, waving goodbye over his shoulder.</p>

**Izumi:** Talk to you later... or maybe not, hopefully.

<p class="centered">Over his shoulder: Hey, wait.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi runs out, and she chases after him, but before she can leave, the next teacher enters.</p>

<p class="centered">He notices Izumi lets him pass so that he wouldn't have to deal with him</p>

**Teacher:** NO RUNNING IN THE CLASS, KUROSAKI.

<p class="centered">The same courtesy is not extended to her.</p>

**Teacher:** And where do you think you're going, miss?

**White-haired Girl:** Why did you let him leave?

**Teacher:** He's a second year; it's beyond me why he was here to begin with, but frankly, I don't care.

**White-haired Girl:** But that boy.

**Teacher:** Alright, alright, settle down, Ms. Miyamoto. You can talk to your boyfriend later; right now, it's my class.

**White-haired Girl:** WHAT! HE'S NOT MY...

<p class="centered">She looks over his shoulder and notices he's completely missing.</p>

**White-haired Girl:** *sighs* Whatever. (I'll get him eventually)

<p class="centered">She goes back and takes a seat, controlling her fury.</p>

**Teacher:** Alright, class, I'm Tanaka. You shall refer to me as Mr. Tanaka.

<p class="centered">A guy stands up from the back.</p>

**Student:** No first name?

**Tanaka:** What are you to call me, Mr. Yuno?

**Yuno:** How do you know my name?

**Tanaka:** I know the name and face of every student in this college.

**Yuno:** Whoa, that's creepy. *whispers to himself* (*But if you know everyone, can you forget everything?*)

**Tanaka:** Not everything, just the regrets.

<p class="centered">Yuno looks at him completely caught off guard.</p>

<p class="centered">Tanaka nods and faces the board moving on to the class</p>

**Yuno:** (What a weird dude.)

<p class="centered">He takes a seat and the class begins.</p>

<p class="centered">*Meanwhile.*</p>

<p class="centered">Aoki leans on a stone pillar, arms crossed, mouth twitching in suppressed fury. Iz

umi approaches carefully, trying to walk past her.</p>

**Aoki:** Don't even think about it, Kurosaki.

<p class="centered">He stops and turns towards her, exasperated but unintimidated.</p>

**Izumi:** Come on, teach, what did I even do?

**Aoki:** Nothing, yet. But something tells me that's going to change soon.

**Izumi:** I'm just here for fun.

**Aoki:** This is no place someone who's just "here for fun" can make it into.

<p class="centered">As he is about to respond, she cuts him off.</p>

**Aoki:** This is my first year as the HOD, and the thing I was most advised about wasn't how to manage finances or academic deadlines. It was not to get involved with you.

**Izumi:** *smiles* I didn't know my notoriety was that high.

<p class="centered">She starts walking, and Izumi follows her.</p>

**Aoki:** I went through your entrance exams. You got exactly 86 out of 100 marks.

**Izumi:** Seems normal enough.

**Aoki:** Yes, except that was the exact cutoff mark for entering. One mark lower and you wouldn't have gotten a seat.

**Izumi:** Really? Phew, that was close, huh?

**Aoki:** You had to have gotten 93 right and the other 7 wrong so that the negative marks would bring your total to 86.

**Izumi:** 93 -- 7 is 86.

**Aoki:** Except, you got the first 93 correct without missing a single one, and somehow got the last 7 wrong in a row.

**Izumi:** *surprised* What? I thought teachers didn't have access to the answer sheets.

**Aoki:** *ignores him* And might I add, you answered the 94th question right, then proceeded to strike it out and choose the wrong one.

**Izumi:** That does look quite suspicious, huh.

**Aoki:** It does.

**Izumi:** What a coincidence!

<p class="centered">She looks at him suspiciously.</p>

**Izumi:** What?

**Aoki:** *sighs* Fine, keep your secrets. I don't know what you're planning to do with your life. But it's none of my concern either. But if you take too many risks to mask your intelligence for whatever reason, you might end up in a situation you may come to regret.

**Izumi:** *smiles* Don't worry, I don't make mistakes.

<p class="centered">He turns around and starts to walk away.</p>

<p class="centered">She extends her arm backwards and grabs him by the back of his collar without turning around.</p>

**Izumi:** HEY, WHAT GIVES?

**Aoki:** I never said I was done with you.

<p class="centered">He escapes her grasp and turns around, continuing to walk with her.</p>

**Izumi:** What more do you want? You're not even my teacher.

**Aoki:** That's irrelevant. I'm the HOD, which means I'm still responsible for you.

**Izumi:** *sighs* Fine.

**Aoki:** Good, are you aware of the fest coming up?

**Izumi:** Sure, I am. I can't wait.

**Aoki:** Really, and what makes you look forward to it so much?

<p class="centered">He keeps his finger on his chin and smiles slyly</p>

**Izumi:** Girls from other universities.

<p class="centered">She hits him on the head.</p>

**Izumi:** OW, hey, you can't hit me.

**Aoki:** Hit? Who hit who?

<p class="centered">He realizes she's just gonna deny it happened and gives up arguing</p>

**Aoki:** *smiles* Well, as the HOD of the most successful department in the university, I've been appointed as the Chief Coordinator of the fest.

**Izumi:** Congratulations. Does that come with a bonus? *grins*

**Aoki:** I don't think that's any of your business, Kurosaki.

<p class="centered">He crosses his arms and looks away in disappointment.</p>

**Aoki:** *smiles* And as the chief, I have a lot of responsibilities.

**Izumi:** I'm sure you do. But what does this have to do with me?

**Aoki:** One of the responsibilities happens to be choosing volunteers for the fest.

**Izumi:** You mean glorified peons.

**Aoki:** That's one way to put it.

**Izumi:** Sure, I can help you with that. I know a couple of girls who would love to do things like that.

**Aoki:** You misunderstand me.

<p class="centered">Izumi realizes where she's going with this, but continues to act in the hopes that he's wrong.</p>

**Izumi:** What do you mean?

**Aoki:** *smirks* You know exactly what I mean.

**Izumi:** Nope, No, Nah, Nein, Nada. Not happening. Nuh uh. Never,

**Aoki:** I wasn't asking Kurosaki.

**Izumi:** I'm not gonna be the university's slave.

**Aoki:** Well then, you'll be pleased to know that in your own words, you won't be a slave.

**Izumi:** (he has a sighs of relief) Phew, thanks, teach. I always knew you were a good one.

**Aoki:** You are gonna be the head slave.

**Izumi:** WHAT?

**Aoki:** I hope you're happy with your posting, head volunteer.

**Izumi:** I'm busy, I can't do this. I'm not responsible at all. I have no sense of direction. I will also be sick on that day, so I can't possibly do my job well.

<p class="centered">They make their way to the chairman's office as Izumi comes with more and more unique reasons.</p>

<p class="centered">Uninterested in his statements, she raises her hand to cover his face and grabs the office door's handle with her other hand.</p>

**Aoki:** I'm not interested in your excuses, Kurosaki. I will call you to meet me later at my office. Right now I have an important meeting to attend. All the best, head volunteer. *smiles*

**Izumi:** But I-

<p class="centered">He reaches his hand out, but before he could finish, she goes in and slams the door shut, and he retracts his hand in defeat.</p>

**Chairman:** What's the problem, Ms. Aoki? What took you so long?

**Aoki:** Oh, Nothing, Sir. Just student problems.

**Chairman:** Oh, how are the freshers for the batch you met?

**Aoki:** Not bad.

**Chairman:** And how are the preparations for the fest coming along?

**Aoki:** (smiles as she thinks about Izumi) Great.

**Chairman:** That's good to hear. Remember, this is the 50th fest. So it has to be the best one so far.

**Aoki:** Don't worry, Chairman. I can promise you this will be the best. *smiles* I have a good feeling about this.

<p class="centered">*Meanwhile*</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi takes a walk down the corridor with his hands in his pockets as he contemplates the fest.</p>

<p class="centered">Her words echo in her head</p>

**Aoki:** (All the best, head volunteer)

<p class="centered">He exhales and throws his head up towards the sky</p>

**Izumi:** Agh, what's her problem?

<p class="centered">As he's walking, a paper ball hits him from the left.</p>

<p class="centered">He turns around, annoyed, and sees a group of kids with paper balls as a guy sitting in the middle juggles a ball.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi decides to ignore them. He turns and continues walking.</p>

<p class="centered">As soon as he turns, another paper ball hits his head as the group laughs.</p>

<p class="centered">This time, he was mildly more annoyed but still decided to proceed with his day.</p>

<p class="centered">Unfortunately, they aren't having it.</p>

<p class="centered">One of the guys steps in front of him and blocks his path</p>

<p class="centered">The guy from the center calls out to Izumi</p>

**Bully:** Hey, Pipsqueak.

<p class="centered">He turns around to look at him, uninterested.</p>

<p class="centered">The bully walks up to him.</p>

**Bully:** Can't you see where you're going? (he says he signals to his friend in front of Izumi.)

**Izumi:** Alright, my bad, sorry guys.

<p class="centered">He tries to squeeze past them, but the bully joins with his friend and blocks him.</p>

**Bully:** I'm afraid an apology isn't gonna be enough.

<p class="centered">He says with a smile as he cracks his knuckles</p>

**Izumi:** *smiles* Of course.

<p class="centered">He takes out his wallet and gives them all his money.</p>

<p class="centered">The bully smacks his outstretched hand</p>

**Bully:** You think we're thugs, we don't want your money.

<p class="centered">As he says that, one of his guys in the background scrambles to pick up all the money.</p>

<p class="centered">The bully looks at them, mad as izumi chuckles</p>

<p class="centered">He approaches Izumi, glaring at him as he towers over him.</p>

**Bully:** What's so funny?

**Izumi:** Nothing.

<p class="centered">The bully grabs him by his collar</p>

**Bully:** *grits his teeth* Watch your mouth, bastard.

**Izumi:** First year?

**Bully:** What about it? Aren't you as well?

**Izumi:** Nah, I'm a second year. (*smiles* Of course he is)

<p class="centered">All of them start laughing</p>

**???:** A second year getting bullied by a first year.

**Bully:** *laughs* Come on, guys, show him some respect, he's our senior.

**Izumi:** So, like, can I go now?

**Bully:** No, you still haven't given me what I want.

**Izumi:** Oh, and what is that?

**Bully:** *smiles* Fear.

**Izumi:** Excuse me?

<p class="centered">He lets go of his collar.</p>

**Bully:** Get down on your knees.

**Izumi:** Kinda gay man.

**Bully:** I'm not playing with you, pipsqueak.

<p class="centered">He says as he shoves him and looks down on him. (He is about 6'2 and Izumi is 5'10)</p>

**Bully:** Fall at my feet.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks down and covers his face.</p>

**Bully:** Hiding in fear?

<p class="centered">As the bully walks towards him, someone calls him from behind.</p>

**???:** HARUTO.

<p class="centered">He turns around to see another guy with his own group, with more mature-looking students.</p>

**Haruto:** Brother?

<p class="centered">One of Haruto's guys looks at the guy in awe.</p>

**??? 1:** Isn't that Nanjo Yusei?

**??? 2:** Yeah, He is a third year, he is like the gang leader around here.

**??? 1:** I heard he's never lost a fight.

**??? 2:** Yeah.

**??? 3:** Except the one time he did.

**??? 1:** Yusei lost?

**??? 2:** Oh, yeah, I've heard about it.

**??? 1:** What happened?

**??? 3:** One guy beat him up, not just him, his entire gang.

**??? 1:** WHAT? (he whispers)

**??? 2:** It's true, the guy was an absolute demon.

**??? 1:** Who was he?

**??? 2:** It's... I can't remember.

**??? 1:** How can you forget something like that?

**??? 2:** My memory was never the strongest, ok.

<p class="centered">Yusei walks over to Haruto.</p>

**Yusei:** Leave him alone.

**Haruto:** Who, this bitch?

**Yusei:** Let. Him. Go. (he says seriously)

**Haruto:** *gnashes his teeth* Fine, Scram, before I change my mind.

<p class="centered">Izumi lifts his head finally and flashes a smile before escaping.</p>

**Izumi:** Phew, thank you, Yusei. I owe you one.

<p class="centered">He runs down the hallway and turns into the corridor out of sight.</p>

**Haruto:** You know who he is?

**Yusei:** Of course I know who he is. How do you not?

**??? 2:** Oh, wait, I just got his name.

**Haruto:** Am I supposed to?

**Yusei:** Yes, you're supposed to.

<p class="centered">Yusei looks in the direction he went, angrily</p>

**Yusei:** That's Kurosaki Izumi.

**??? 2:** His name is... (he hears what Yusei says) WHAT.

**??? 1:** What happened?

**??? 2:** H-h-hi-his name is, K-Ku-Kurosaki... Izumi.

**??? 1:** Oh, wait, so that guy was.

**??? 2:** *gulps* Yeah, that was him. (he says borderline speechlessly)

**??? 1:** WHAT.

**Haruto:** WHAT?! That's Izumi?!

**Yusei:** Yes.

**Haruto:** But he was scared shitless of me; he was even looking down, trying to hide his face in fear.

**Yusei:** He wasn't hiding anything. He doesn't feel fear.

<p class="centered">He remembers his face right then, and has flashbacks of his face from the fight last year..</p>

**Yusei:** He was trying to hide his smile.

**Haruto:** What?

<p class="centered">He looks in disbelief at where Izumi went</p>

**Haruto:** Who the hell is that guy, or rather, what is he?
