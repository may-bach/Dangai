<p class="centered">The next day...</p>

<p class="centered">The morning sun bleeds through the windows of the administrative block as Ms. Aoki walks down the hallway. The rhythmic click-clack of her heels echoing against the pristine walls. She adjusts the stack of files in her arms, her mind racing ahead of her feet.</p>

**Aoki:** (Now we have a head for the fest, he’s going to need an assistant.)

<p class="centered">She recalls the chaos of the previous day—the screaming girls, the fanfare.</p>

**Aoki:** (That shouldn’t be too hard. I'm sure there should be at least one person in this university fit for the role, probably a third or fourth year.)

<p class="centered">She enters the classroom, the heavy door sliding shut behind her. She sets her books and laptop on the teacher's desk with a deliberate thud. The chatter dies down instantly. The students stand in unison, chairs scraping against the floor.</p>

**Students:** Good morning, Ma’am.

**Aoki:** Good morning, take a seat.

<p class="centered">Everyone gets seated as Aoki leans against the desk, scanning the room.</p>

**Aoki:** Alright, students, before we get started with our first lesson, I have something important to share. As you all know, we have our university’s annual fest coming up. Our fest is the biggest one among all the universities in the world. Lots of students from other universities, even outside our prefecture and even country, come to see the show we put on. And it goes without saying that this is one of the most important events of Kansai University. So I hope you will understand the seriousness of the position I’m about to request one of you to undertake.

<p class="centered">She pauses for effect, letting the weight of the responsibility hang in the air. The girl sitting in the front row—the same one who had questioned her neighbor about Izumi—looks up, interested.</p>

**Neighbor Girl:** Which is?

**Aoki:** The assistant head volunteer of the fest.

<p class="centered">The students whisper amongst themselves.</p>

**Aoki:** So, is anyone up to the task?

<p class="centered">A student raises his hand, looking skeptical.</p>

**Student:** Isn't this an important role? Shouldn’t you be giving it to a third or fourth year?

**Aoki:** I should, but this isn't any other university. You can't get into Kansai being mediocre. So I want to give all of you a fair chance. Anyone interested, raise their hands.

<p class="centered">She closes her eyes for a moment, visualizing the ideal candidate.</p>

**Aoki:** (It would be nice to have a student from my own class be chosen for the position. Even on the off chance that no one in the university is interested, I could at least let these guys know who the head volunteer is, maybe that would-)

<p class="centered">The sound of tables shifting and chairs sliding interrupts her thoughts. She opens her eyes. A forest of hands has shot up. She hides her surprise behind a small smile.</p>

**Aoki:** Nice, so we have something to work with. All of you write down your names on a sheet of paper and give it to….

<p class="centered">She looks around the classroom, and her eyes settle on the first row.</p>

**Aoki:** You, what's your name?

<p class="centered">She points to the girl with white hair.</p>

**Hitsumi (White-haired Girl):** Miyamoto Hitsumi.

**Aoki:** Oh, you’re the one who got the top score in this class, am I correct?

**Hitsumi:** I'm not sure, but it's possible.

**Aoki:** Well, in that case, you will be the class representative. Collect the names of all the students and give them to me by the end of the day.

**Hitsumi:** Yes, ma’am.

**Aoki:** Good, now, let’s move on to the lesson.

<p class="centered">She turns to the digital board, the stylus tapping against the screen as she begins to write.</p>

**Aoki:** Today, we’re gonna be revising all the basics of physics you should’ve learnt in college, so let's start with motion.

<p class="centered">Fifty minutes blur by in a haze of equations and diagrams.</p>

**Aoki:** That's all for nanomaterials. And that should be it for the recap. In the next class, we’ll start with quantum physics, our first chapter. That will take place in four hours. Until then, you’re free. Miyamoto, take note of all the names.

**Hitsumi:** Yes, ma’am.

<p class="centered">She stands up and asks everyone to line up and come write their name on her paper.</p>

<p class="centered">As the people line up, causing chaos, she settles them down.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Single line, you there, stop trying to cut in.

**Aoki:** (*smiles* Good leadership and management.) Find me in my room, Miyamoto. I'm assuming you know where that is.

**Hitsumi:** Of course I do.

**Aoki:** Good.

<p class="centered">Aoki gathers her things and exits. Hitsumi stays behind, managing the flow of students, checking names with precision. Finally, the room clears. She glances at the list.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Alright.

**Neighbor Girl:** Already the teacher’s pet?

**Hitsumi:** Oh, please, it's not like I want to do it. I'm only going through with it because my parents want me to take part in everything.

**Neighbor Girl:** Interesting, so you’re not like a nerd or anything, right?

<p class="centered">Hitsumi gives her a flat, unimpressed look.</p>

**Hitsumi:** What do you think?

**Neighbor Girl:** *smiles* You seem like fun, my name’s Yurika Ino.

<p class="centered">She extends her hand, Hitsumi smiles and shakes it.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Nice to meet you.

<p class="centered">Meanwhile, in the canteen</p>

<p class="centered">The cafeteria is a roar of noise—clattering trays, shouting students, and the hiss of soda machines. Izumi stands near the vending machine, debating his choices, when a voice cuts through the din.</p>

**Chloe:** It's pretty hard to get a hold of you.

<p class="centered">Izumi turns around, surprised.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh, Chloe, my bad, I forgot to hand you my number.

<p class="centered">She smiles and hands him her phone.</p>

**Chloe:** Never too late.

<p class="centered">He smiles and puts his number into her phone.</p>

**Izumi:** So, should I save it as boyfriend or baby?

**Chloe:** *laughs* Hold your horses cowboy. Izumi will do for now.

**Izumi:** You sure?

**Chloe:** Yeah, I’m pretty sure.

<p class="centered">They laugh as he hands her back the phone, their fingers brushing.</p>

**Chloe:** So when are you gonna take me out?

**Izumi:** What about later tomorrow?

**Chloe:** Sure, you better remember this time.

**Izumi:** Of course.

**Chloe:** See you later, Izumi.

<p class="centered">She waves and walks away, disappearing into the crowd.</p>

<p class="centered">Kenji comes from behind and puts his arms around his shoulders.</p>

**Kenji:** It seems like you and the blondie are getting along pretty well.

**Izumi:** Is that surprising?

**Kenji:** Not really. So, what are you planning to do about the thing with Ms. Aoki?

**Izumi:** *sighs* I don’t know, man. I don’t really want to work.

**Kenji:** Understandable. Hopefully, you get a good assistant.

**Izumi:** How does it even matter? I work better alone anyways.

**Kenji:** I know that. What I meant was, since you don’t wanna work at all. You can just push all the work onto them.

<p class="centered">Izumi pauses. A slow, devious smile spreads across his face.</p>

**Izumi:** That… sounds like a plan *smiles*. I completely forgot about that.

**Kenji:** It would be even better if it turns out to be a hot girl.

<p class="centered">They both grin, rubbing their hands together like cartoon villains.</p>

**Izumi:** As long as it's not a guy, it would be bearable.

**Kenji:** Even an ugly girl?

**Izumi:** There aren't ugly girls in KU.

**Kenji:** Fair enough. So, I'm guessing you’re gonna cut afternoon classes.

**Izumi:** Of course.

**Kenji:** And what are you gonna do?

**Izumi:** I don’t know. I had a date with a girl, but I don’t know why; I just don’t feel like going.

**Kenji:** You? Don't feel like talking to a girl?

**Izumi:** It’s not like that. I just wanna relax.

**Kenji:** A date is probably the most relaxing thing for you.

**Izumi:** Maybe so, but I haven't done anything active in a while. Wanna hoop later?

**Kenji:** *smiles* Wanna? Of course I do, how much are we talking?

**Izumi:** Loser buys dinner.

**Kenji:** You’re on.

**Izumi:** *smiles* Well come on, let's get a move on, it seems like it’s about to rain.

<p class="centered">They smile as they walk towards the court blending into a sea of students.</p>

---

<p class="centered">In Aoki’s Cabin</p>

<p class="centered">The office is quiet, a sanctuary from the campus noise and the loud thunder. A sharp knock rattles the door.</p>

**Aoki:** Come in.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi enters, closing the door softly behind her and approaches the desk.</p>

**Aoki:** Ah, Miyamoto, I’m guessing you’re here to give me the list.

**Hitsumi:** Yes, ma’am.

<p class="centered">Aoki clears a space on her cluttered desk. Hitsumi places the paper down, smoothing the edges.</p>

**Aoki:** Alright.

<p class="centered">Aoki runs her finger down the list, lips moving silently as she counts. Hitsumi stands at attention, hands clasped behind her back.</p>

**Aoki:** So 28 out of 70 volunteered.

**Aoki:** Alright, inform them that I will hold an interview tomorrow after the afternoon class.

**Hitsumi:** I’ll let them know.

**Aoki:** Thank you, Miyamoto.

**Hitsumi:** You’re welcome, ma’am.

<p class="centered">Aoki opens her laptop, the screen illuminating her face as she prepares to check student backgrounds. Hitsumi turns to leave, but stops at the door, curiosity getting the better of her.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Ma’am, if you don’t mind, there’s something I’d like to know.

**Aoki:** Sure.

**Hitsumi:** Who’s the Head volunteer?

**Aoki:** It’s Iz-

<p class="centered">She stops. She remembers the altercation in the hallway—Hitsumi gripping Izumi’s collar, the shouting. A mischievous glint enters Aoki’s eye.</p>

**Aoki:** *smiles* Actually, let it be a surprise.

**Hitsumi:** A surprise?

**Aoki:** Yes.

<p class="centered">Slightly confused, she lets go of it and proceeds to exit, but Aoki stops her beforehand.</p>

**Aoki:** Miyamoto, wait.

**Hitsumi:** Yes?

**Aoki:** How about this? I'm gonna interview you right now, and if you pass, you get the role.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi spins around, eyes wide.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Really?

**Aoki:** Yes.

**Hitsumi:** Alright, I'm ready.

**Aoki:** Alright, Miyamoto, what’s your reason for applying for this position?

**Hitsumi:** I feel like this would be an invaluable opportunity to learn how to manage events and coordinate people to get stuff done in an efficient manner. This is easily one of the biggest events in Japan, so if I can manage this, I should be able to manage anything, and this will add a lot to my resume.

**Aoki:** Alright, what makes you different from the rest?

**Hitsumi:** My strength is my adaptability. When a plan fails, I don't look for blame; I look for the fastest possible workaround and execute it instantly. I don't get flustered, which means I can get a solution faster than the problem can grow and create chaos.

**Aoki:** Have you ever done something similar previously?

**Hitsumi:** Yes. In high school, I organized a large regional competition. We lost our main venue two days before the event. I handled the crisis and secured a replacement, rerouted logistics, and managed the team on the fly. We delivered the event successfully, on time and under budget.

**Aoki:** Good. Finally, *smiles* How compatible do you think you are with working alongside people who aren't very cooperative?

<p class="centered">Hitsumi tilts her head, slightly confused by the specificity of the question.</p>

**Hitsumi:** I'm highly compatible. My approach isn't to issue demands, but to lead the execution. When I delegate a task, I ensure the team has the resources and clarity to succeed, and I'm ready to jump into the details alongside them. My goal isn't just a friendly environment, but a productive one.

**Aoki:** That's good to hear. You may find that your new primary task won't be execution, but rather managing a highly intelligent variable whose primary goal is non-compliance.

**Hitsumi:** What do you mean?

**Aoki:** Your head, he might try to actively sabotage the event.

**Hitsumi:** WHAT?!

<p class="centered">She is taken back by her statement in shock.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Then why was he even appointed for the job?

**Aoki:** I have my reasons. The question is, are you up to the task?

<p class="centered">She replies confidently, unaware of the situation she has just signed up for.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Of course. Dealing with opposition is a test of true management. I’ll make sure he respects me and the event and does his best to make this a success.

<p class="centered">Aoki laughs after hearing that.</p>

**Aoki:** All the best with that. Well then, Ms. Miyamoto.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, you mean?

**Aoki:** Yes, you’re selected.

**Hitsumi:** THANK YOU, MA’AM.

<p class="centered">She bows down respectfully, full of enthusiasm.</p>

**Aoki:** Don't worry about it, your real challenge starts now.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* Yes, I'll make sure you don’t regret this decision.

**Aoki:** I'm sure I won’t. Now get going. It's almost 9:30 PM, they’re gonna close the dormitories. And it’s raining pretty hard out there.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi checks the clock on the wall and gasps.</p>

**Hitsumi:** OH, please excuse me, ma’am.

<p class="centered">She hurries to the door, bowing one last time before practically sprinting out.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Thank you again.

<p class="centered">Aoki smiles and leans back in her leather chair, spinning slowly to face the floor to ceiling window. Rain streaks the glass, distorting the view of the city district of Kansai University blazing with power. Massive illuminated billboards and towering glass highrises glowing with the flashes of lightning in the dark sky. The wide avenues below shone with brilliant white streetlights and the endless golden glow of thousands of apartment windows, shimmering through the downpour.</p>

<p class="centered">She shifted her gaze to the massive open grounds adjacent to the city center. Harsh industrial floodlights bathe the area in white, the beams cutting through the heavy sheets of rain to expose a skeleton of steel and wood. Construction crews swarm over the half built main stage, their welding torches sparking against the dark iron frames. The vast, empty plaza was slowly transforming into a chaotic maze of stalls and towering scaffolding, undeterred by the rumbling storm above.</p>

**Aoki:** This is gonna be quite a fest, huh.

<p class="centered">Elsewhere</p>

<p class="centered">The night air drifted cold through the open walls of an abandoned building. Haruto stood in the center of the concrete shell, lit up only by the lightning. He reared back and kicked a football with all his might. The impact echoed violently off the bare pillars as the ball smashed into a glass bottle placed on a stack of bricks, shattering it into a thousand glittering shards.</p>

**Guy:** So what did Mr. Nanjou say?

**Haruto:** He told me to back off from Kurosaki.

**Guy 2:** What, why? I know he has done a lot, but he seems so weak.

<p class="centered">Haruto grits his teeth, the memory of his private conversation with Yusei playing in his head like a broken record.</p>

<p class="centered">*(Flashback)*</p>

**Yusei:** Don't mess with that guy.

**Haruto:** Brother, I'm telling you, we can take him on.

**Yusei:** Take him on? *laughs insultingly* You’d be lucky to leave with your life, let alone land a hit.

**Haruto:** Are we even talking about the same person?

**Yusei:** *sighs* You’re right, we’re not. What you saw yesterday was just a normal human. If you catch him on a good day, you might beat him up a bit.

<p class="centered">Yusei stares into the distance at a huge river lit up by lightning and moonlight, his eyes darkening as he remembers what happened last year.</p>

<p class="centered">A flash of Izumi with a gold glint in his eyes and a smile which can only be described as insane; walking over bodies of knocked out students towards Yusei.</p>

**Yusei:** But what I saw that day was anything but human.

**Haruto:** *confused* I don’t get it. You’re the biggest guy in the university, everyone listens to you, and even the teachers are afraid of you. Then why are you so wary of that scrawny guy?

**Yusei:** Listen, Haruto, as long as you bully him, poke a few jokes, or even go as far as hitting him a couple times, you’re good. But I know you. As you grow tired of doing the same thing and him smiling through everything, you’re gonna get mad and find another way to annoy him. And that way will surely be to go after the people he cares about.

<p class="centered">He smiles, with a face painted with malice.</p>

**Haruto:** And what's the problem with that?

**Yusei:** The problem is, as long as you go after him, he will deal with it.

<p class="centered">Yusei steps close, invading Haruto’s personal space.</p>

**Yusei:** But the moment you go after the people he loves…

<p class="centered">He looks him in the eyes, dead serious.</p>

**Yusei:** You will regret it.

<p class="centered">Haruto steps back, slightly scared.</p>

**Haruto:** Fine, fine, I won’t.

**Yusei:** Good, don’t forget it, DON’T mess with Kurosaki.

<p class="centered">*(End of Flashback)*</p>

<p class="centered">As the lightning surges, so does his rage as he kicks another ball into another glass.</p>

<p class="centered">The sound of the glass breaking resonates with the thunder.</p>

**Haruto:** I don’t know.

<p class="centered">Slowly, his frown turns into a sly smile.</p>

**Haruto:** I'm sorry, brother, but I can't listen to you. I refuse to believe he's that strong.

**Girl:** So what are you gonna do about him?

**Haruto:** Just wait, we will strike soon enough.

<p class="centered">A rooster crows as the next day rolls around</p>
<p class="centered">In the upper floors of the biggest apartment/skyscraper in the city district</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi groans, peeling himself off his bedsheets. He moves through his morning routine with the speed of a sloth. He brushes his teeth, eyes half-closed. He showers. He pulls on his classic outfit, white tee, dark pants. And finally he puts on his black denim jacket.</p>

<p class="centered">He checks himself in front of the mirror as he puts on his perfume and exits his place.</p>

<p class="centered">As he walks through the hallway he waves, with a smile at the rich folks there who look at him with a mix of disgust and animosity which he brushes off with a shrug.</p>

<p class="centered">He takes the elevator down from his penthouse to the basement to get on his bike.</p>

<p class="centered">He puts his hands in his pockets and realizes he forgot his key.</p>

**Izumi:** (Shit).

<p class="centered">As he sighs and turns around to go back all the way up to the 50th floor, Kenji brakes his motorcycle in front of him and smiles.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi responds with a smile as well and hops on the back.</p>

**Kenji:** You coming to class today?

**Izumi:** Of course not.

**Kenji:** Figured.

**Izumi:** I'll just walk with you till class and go sleep in a free room or something.

<p class="centered">They park their motorcycle outside the academic block for CSE and walk to the elevator.</p>

**Kenji:** It’s just 6 floors man.

**Izumi:** Just?

**Kenji:** Come on, it will be good cardio.

<p class="centered">He brushes him off and waits for the elevator, and Kenji surrenders.</p>

<p class="centered">They get on and exit the elevator in silence and pace down the hallway towards their class.</p>

**Kenji:** You have a date today, right, with Chloe?

**Izumi:** Oh yeah, that too, hopefully nothing pops up today.

<p class="centered">As they are walking to class, they get cut off.</p>

**???:** Good morning, Kurosaki.

<p class="centered">He freezes in fear and turns around slowly, hoping it's not who he thinks it is.</p>

**Izumi:** *awkward smile* Good morning Ms. Aoki.

**Aoki:** Where are you headed?

**Izumi:** Class, where else?

**Aoki:** I believe your friend is going to class, but are you?

**Izumi:** Sure I am.

<p class="centered">She gives him a look that says she knows exactly what his attendance record looks like.</p>

**Izumi:** Maybe not?

**Aoki:** Good, follow me.

**Izumi:** What, why should I-

<p class="centered">Izumi and Aoki stand outside her classroom.</p>

<p class="centered">Through the window, Izumi watches students playing football in the sports field, longing to be there.</p>

**Aoki:** Stay out.

<p class="centered">He sighs and leans against the wall.</p>

<p class="centered">Inside, the students greet Ms. Aoki.</p>

**Students:** Good morning, Ms. Aoki.

**Aoki:** Good morning, students. Today I won’t be taking a class. Just revise everything we learnt about quantum mechanics during yesterday’s evening class.

<p class="centered">Celebratory whispers ripple through the room.</p>

**Aoki:** Ms. Miyamoto. Meet me outside.

<p class="centered">She gets caught off guard but agrees and walks out with her.</p>

**Hitsumi:** What's the matter, Ms. Aoki?

**Aoki:** You wanted to know who’s your head right.

<p class="centered">Izumi hears voices and turns around lazily towards the class as Aoki gestures toward him.</p>

**Aoki:** Meet your head, Kurosaki Izumi. Kurosaki, meet your assistant, Miyamoto Hitsumi.

<p class="centered">As they look at each other, the calm before the storm ensues.</p>
