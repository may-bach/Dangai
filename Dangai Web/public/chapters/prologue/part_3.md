<p class="centered">*The next day...*</p>

<p class="centered">The morning sun bleeds through the windows of the administrative block as Ms. Aoki walks down the hallway. The rhythmic *click-clack* of her heels echoing against the pristine walls. She adjusts the stack of files in her arms, her mind already racing ahead of her feet.</p>

**Aoki:** (Now we have a head for the fest, he's going to need an assistant.)

<p class="centered">She recalls the chaos of the previous day---the screaming girls, the fanfare.</p>

**Aoki:** (That shouldn't be too hard.)

<p class="centered">She enters the classroom, the heavy door sliding shut behind her. She sets her books and laptop on the teacher's desk with a deliberate thud. The chatter dies down instantly. The students stand in unison, chairs scraping against the floor.</p>

**Students:** Good morning, Ma'am.

**Aoki:** Good morning, take a seat.

<p class="centered">Everyone gets seated as Aoki leans against the desk, scanning the room.</p>

**Aoki:** Alright, students, before we get started with our first lesson, I have something important to share. As you all know, we have our university's annual fest coming up. Our fest is the biggest one among all the universities in our prefecture. Lots of students from other universities, even outside our prefecture, come to see the show we put on. And it goes without saying that this is one of the most important events of Kansai University. So I hope you will understand the seriousness of the position I'm about to request one of you to undertake.

<p class="centered">She pauses for effect, letting the weight of the responsibility hang in the air. The girl sitting in the front row---the same one who had questioned her neighbor about Izumi---looks up, interested.</p>

**Neighbor Girl:** Which is?

**Aoki:** The assistant head volunteer.

<p class="centered">The students whisper amongst themselves.</p>

**Aoki:** So, is anyone up to the task?

<p class="centered">A student raises his hand, looking skeptical.</p>

**Student:** Isn't this an important role? Shouldn't you be giving it to a third or fourth year?

**Aoki:** I should, but this isn't any other university. You can't get into Kansai being mediocre. So I want to give all of you a fair chance. Anyone interested, raise their hands.

<p class="centered">She closes her eyes for a moment, visualizing the ideal candidate.</p>

**Aoki:** (It would be nice to have a student from my own class be chosen for the position, so in case no one in the university is interested, I could at least let these guys know who the head is, maybe that would-)

<p class="centered">The sound of tables shifting and chairs sliding interrupts her thoughts. She opens her eyes. A forest of hands has shot up. She hides her surprise behind a small smile.</p>

**Aoki:** Nice, so we have something to work with. *smiles* All of you write down your names on a sheet of paper and give it to....

<p class="centered">She looks around the classroom, and her eyes settle on the first row.</p>

**Aoki:** You, what's your name?

<p class="centered">She points to the girl with white hair.</p>

**Hitsumi (White-haired Girl):** Miyamoto Hitsumi.

**Aoki:** Oh, you're the one who got the top score in this class, am I correct?

**Hitsumi:** I'm not sure, but it's possible.

**Aoki:** Well, in that case, you will be the class representative. Collect the names of all the students and give them to me by the end of the day.

**Hitsumi:** Yes, ma'am.

**Aoki:** Good, now, let's move on to the lesson.

<p class="centered">She turns to the digital board, the stylus tapping against the screen as she begins to write.</p>

**Aoki:** Today, we're gonna be revising all the basics of physics you should've learnt in college, so let's start with motion.

<p class="centered">*Fifty minutes blur by in a haze of equations and diagrams.*</p>

**Aoki:** That's all for nanomaterials. And that should be it for the recap. In the next class, we'll start with quantum physics our first chapter. That will take place in four hours. Until then, you're free. Miyamoto takes note of all the names.

**Hitsumi:** Yes, ma'am.

<p class="centered">She stands up and asks everyone to line up and come write their name on her paper.</p>

<p class="centered">As the people line up, causing chaos, she settles them down.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Single line, you there, stop trying to cut in.

**Aoki:** (*smiles* Good leadership.) Find me in my room, Miyamoto. I'm assuming you know where that is.

**Hitsumi:** Of course I do.

**Aoki:** Good.

<p class="centered">Aoki gathers her things and exits. Hitsumi stays behind, managing the flow of students, checking names with precision. Finally, the room clears. She glances at the list.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Alright.

**Neighbor Girl:** Already the teacher's pet?

**Hitsumi:** Oh, please, it's not like I want to do it. I'm only going through with it because my parents want me to take part in everything.

**Neighbor Girl:** Interesting, so you're not a nerd, right?

<p class="centered">Hitsumi gives her a flat, unimpressed look.</p>

**Hitsumi:** What do you think?

**Neighbor Girl:** *smiles* You seem like fun, my name's Yurika Ino.

<p class="centered">She extends her hand.</p>

<p class="centered">Hitsumi smiles and shakes it.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Nice to meet you.

<p class="centered">*Meanwhile, in the canteen*</p>

<p class="centered">The cafeteria is a roar of noise---clattering trays, shouting students, and the hiss of soda machines. Izumi stands near the vending machine, debating his choices, when a voice cuts through the din</p>

**Chloe:** It's pretty hard to get a hold of you.

<p class="centered">Izumi turns around, surprised.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh, Chloe, my bad, I forgot to hand you my number.

<p class="centered">She smiles and hands him her phone</p>

**Chloe:** Never too late.

<p class="centered">He smiles and puts his number into her phone.</p>

**Izumi:** So, should I save it as boyfriend or baby?

**Chloe:** *laughs* Hold your horses, cowboy. Izumi will do for now.

**Izumi:** You sure?

**Chloe:** Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

<p class="centered">He laughs and hands the phone back, their fingers brushing.</p>

**Chloe:** So when are you gonna take me out?

**Izumi:** What about later tomorrow?

**Chloe:** Tomorrow?

**Izumi:** Yeah, after all your classes are done.

**Chloe:** It's a date.

<p class="centered">He grins and they both begin to head their separate ways.</p>

<p class="centered">*Meanwhile somewhere in another district*</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi and Kenji arrive at a basketball court.</p>

<p class="centered">A bunch of students are playing 3v3 in the far basket. Izumi walks over and grabs a basketball from the ground and takes a shot but misses horribly.</p>

**Kenji:** Ha, rusty.

<p class="centered">He grabs the ball and makes the shot effortlessly.</p>

**Izumi:** Just shut up.

<p class="centered">They play for an hour</p>

<p class="centered">By the end Izumi takes a foul shot from the far end of the court</p>

<p class="centered">It makes a perfect arch and goes in without bouncing off the edges.</p>

**Izumi:** Nice.

**Kenji:** Yup, you're back in your usual form.

<p class="centered">Izumi lies down on the floor with his bag as a pillow.</p>

<p class="centered">Kenji takes a seat on the nearby bench.</p>

**Kenji:** Aren't you going on a date tomorrow?

**Izumi:** Yeah, why?

**Kenji:** I thought you'd be preparing for it.

**Izumi:** Preparing? What is there to prepare for?

**Kenji:** I don't know, maybe a conversation starter or plans for what you're actually going to do.

**Izumi:** Well I have the place sorted, and conversation starters are for people who are desperate.

**Kenji:** Aren't you?

**Izumi:** Well not that desperate.

**Kenji:** Yeah? You know, normally people who go out on dates hope for it to continue into a relationship.

**Izumi:** That's not gonna happen.

**Kenji:** Oh, what happened?

**Izumi:** Nothing, it's just that I'm not interested in that.

**Kenji:** Then why are you going out with her?

**Izumi:** Cause it's fun to do.

**Kenji:** Right, so you have no actual interest in pursuing a relationship, so what, is it just for the thrill? Or for the chase.

**Izumi:** I guess.

**Kenji:** You're really weird man.

**Izumi:** It's not like that. I just wanna relax.

**Kenji:** A date is probably the most relaxing thing for you.

**Izumi:** Maybe so, but I haven't done anything active in a while. Wanna hoop later?

**Kenji:** *smiles* Wanna? Of course I do, how much are we talking?

**Izumi:** Loser buys dinner.

**Kenji:** You're on.

**Izumi:** *smiles* Well come on, let's get a move on, it seems like it's about to rain.

<p class="centered">They smile as they walk towards the court blending into a sea of students.</p>

<p class="centered">*In Aoki's Cabin*</p>

<p class="centered">The office is quiet, a sanctuary from the campus noise and the loud thunder. A sharp knock rattles the door.</p>

**Aoki:** Come in.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi enters, closing the door softly behind her and approaches the desk.</p>

**Aoki:** Ah, Miyamoto, I'm guessing you're here to give me the list.

**Hitsumi:** Yes, ma'am.

<p class="centered">She makes some space on her desk.</p>

<p class="centered">Aoki clears a space on her cluttered desk. Hitsumi places the paper down, smoothing the edges.</p>

**Aoki:** Alright.

<p class="centered">Aoki runs her finger down the list, lips moving silently as she counts. Hitsumi stands at attention, hands clasped behind her back.</p>

**Aoki:** So 28 out of 70 volunteered.

**Aoki:** Alright, inform them that I will hold an interview tomorrow after the afternoon class.

**Hitsumi:** I'll let them know.

**Aoki:** Thank you, Miyamoto.

**Hitsumi:** You're welcome, ma'am.

<p class="centered">Aoki opens her laptop, the screen illuminating her face as she prepares to check student backgrounds. Hitsumi turns to leave, but stops at the door, curiosity getting the better of her.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Ma'am, if you don't mind, there's something I'd like to know.

**Aoki:** Sure.

**Hitsumi:** Who's the Head volunteer?

**Aoki:** It's Iz-

<p class="centered">She stops. She remembers the altercation in the hallway---Hitsumi gripping Izumi's collar, the shouting. A mischievous glint enters Aoki's eye.</p>

**Aoki:** *smiles* Actually, let it be a surprise.

**Hitsumi:** A surprise?

**Aoki:** Yes.

<p class="centered">Slightly confused, she lets go of it and proceeds to exit, but Aoki stops her beforehand.</p>

**Aoki:** Miyamoto, wait.

**Hitsumi:** Yes?

**Aoki:** How about this? I'm gonna interview you right now, and if you pass, you get the role.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi spins around, eyes wide.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Really?

**Aoki:** Yes.

**Hitsumi:** Alright, I'm ready.

**Aoki:** Alright, Miyamoto, what's your reason for applying for this position?

**Hitsumi:** I feel like this would be an invaluable opportunity to learn how to manage events and coordinate people to get stuff done in an efficient manner. This is easily one of the biggest events in Japan, so if I can manage this, I should be able to manage anything, and this will add a lot to my resume.

**Aoki:** Alright, what makes you different from the rest?

**Hitsumi:** My strength is my adaptability. When a plan fails, I don't look for blame; I look for the fastest possible workaround and execute the pivot instantly. I don't get flustered, which means I can get a solution faster than the problem can grow and create chaos.

**Aoki:** Have you ever done something similar previously?

**Hitsumi:** Yes. In high school, I organized a large regional competition. We lost our main venue two days before the event. I handled the crisis---securing a replacement, rerouting logistics, and managing the team on the fly. We delivered the event successfully, on time and under budget.

**Aoki:** Good. Finally,*smiles* How compatible do you think you are with working alongside people who aren't very cooperative?

<p class="centered">Hitsumi tilts her head, slightly confused by the specificity of the question.</p>

**Hitsumi:** I'm highly compatible. My approach isn't to issue demands, but to lead the execution. When I delegate a task, I ensure the team has the resources and clarity to succeed, and I'm ready to jump into the details alongside them. My goal isn't just a friendly environment, but a productive one.

**Aoki:** That's good to hear. You may find that your new primary task won't be execution, but rather managing a highly intelligent variable whose primary goal is non-compliance.

**Hitsumi:** What do you mean?

**Aoki:** Your head, he might try to actively sabotage the event.

**Hitsumi:** WHAT? Then why was he even appointed for the job?

**Aoki:** I have my reasons. The question is, are you up to the task?

<p class="centered">She replies confidently, unaware of the situation she has just signed up for.</p>

**HItsumi:** Of course. Dealing with opposition is a test of true management. I'll make sure he respects me and the event and does his best to make this a success.

<p class="centered">Aoki laughs after hearing that.</p>

**Aoki:** All the best with that, then, Ms. Miyamoto.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, you mean?

**Aoki:** Yes, you're selected.

**Hitsumi:** THANK YOU, MA'AM.

<p class="centered">She bows down respectfully.</p>

**Aoki:** Don't worry about it, you're real challenge starts now.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* Yes, I'll make sure you don't regret this decision.

**Aoki:** I'm sure I won't. Now get going. It's almost 9:30 PM, they're gonna close the dormitories. And it's raining pretty hard out there.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi checks the clock on the wall and gasps.</p>

**Hitsumi:** OH, please excuse me, ma'am.

<p class="centered">She hurries to the door, bowing one last time before practically sprinting out.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Thank you again.

<p class="centered">Aoki smiles and leans back in her leather chair, spinning slowly to face the floor-to-ceiling window. Rain streaks the glass, distorting the view of the elite district blazing with power. Massive illuminated billboards and towering glass high-rises glowed defiant against the flashes of lightning in the dark sky. The wide avenues below shone with brilliant white streetlights and the endless golden glow of thousands of apartment windows, shimmering through the downpour.</p>

<p class="centered">She shifted her gaze to the massive open grounds adjacent to the city center. Harsh industrial floodlights bathe the area in white, the beams cutting through the heavy sheets of rain to expose a rising skeleton of steel and wood. Construction crews swarm over the half-built main stage, their welding torches sparking against the slick, dark iron frames. The vast, empty plaza was slowly transforming into a chaotic maze of stalls and towering scaffolding, undeterred by the rumbling storm above.</p>

**Aoki:** This is gonna be quite a fest, huh.

<p class="centered">*Elsewhere*</p>

<p class="centered">The night air drifted cold through the open walls of the unfinished building. Haruto stood in the center of the concrete shell, lit up only by the lightning. He reared back and kicked a football with all his might. The impact echoed violently off the bare pillars as the ball smashed into a glass bottle perched on a stack of bricks, shattering it into a thousand glittering shards.</p>

**Guy:** So what did Mr.Nanjou say?

**Haruto:** He told me to back off from Kurosaki.

**Guy 2:** What, why? I know he has done a lot, but he seems so weak.

<p class="centered">Haruto grits his teeth, the memory of his private conversation with Yusei playing in his head like a broken record.</p>

<p class="centered">*(Flashback)*</p>

**Yusei:** Don't mess with that guy.

**Haruto:** Brother, I'm telling you, we can take him on.

**Yusei:** Take him on? *laguhs insultingly* You'd be lucky to land a hit and leave with your life.

**Haruto:** Are we even talking about the same person?

**Yusei:** *sighs* You're right, we're not. What you saw yesterday was just a normal human? If you catch him on a good day, you might beat him up a bit.

<p class="centered">Yusei stares into the middle distance, his eyes darkening as he remembers what happened last year.</p>

**Yusei:** But what I saw then was anything but human.

**Haruto:** *confused* I don't get it. You're the biggest guy in the university, everyone listens to you, and even the teachers are afraid of you. Then why are you so wary of that scrawny guy?

**Yusei:** Listen, Haruto, as long as you bully him, poke a few jokes, or even go as far a hitting him a couple times, you're good. But I know you. As you grow tired of doing the same thing and him smiling through everything, you're gonna get mad and find another way to annoy him. And that way will surely be to go after the people he cares about.

**Haruto:** *smiles with malice* And what's the problem with that?

**Yusei:** The problem is, as long as you go after him, he will deal with it.

<p class="centered">Yusei steps close, invading Haruto's personal space.</p>

**Yusei:** But the moment you go after the people he loves...

<p class="centered">He looks him in the eyes, dead serious.</p>

**Yusei:** You will regret it.

<p class="centered">Haruto steps back, slightly scared.</p>

**Haruto:** Fine, fine, I won't.

**Yusei:** Good, don't forget it, DON'T mess with Kurosaki.

<p class="centered">*(Flashback)*</p>

<p class="centered">As the lightning surges so does his rage as he kicks another ball into another glass.</p>

<p class="centered">The sound of the glass breaking resonates with the thunder</p>

**Haruto:** I don't know.

<p class="centered">Slowly, his frown turns into a sly smile.</p>

**Haruto:** I'm sorry, brother, but I can't listen to you. I refuse to believe he's that strong.

**Girl:** So what are you gonna do about him?

**Haruto:** Just wait, we will strike soon enough.
