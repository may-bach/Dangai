**PART-3**

<p class="centered"><em>The next day.</em></p>

<p class="centered">Ms. Aoki thinks to herself as she walks down the hallway to her class.</p>

**Aoki:** *(Now we have a head for the fest, he's going to need an assistant.)*

<p class="centered">She remembers all the girls shouting his name in the class.</p>

**Aoki:** *(That shouldn't be too hard.)*

<p class="centered">She enters the class and keeps her books and other stuff on the teacher's desk. The students stand up to greet her.</p>

**Students:** Good morning Ma'am.

**Aoki:** Good morning, take a seat.

<p class="centered">Everyone gets seated down.</p>

**Aoki:** Alright students, before we get started with our first lesson, I have something important to share. As you all know we have our university's annual fest coming up. Our fest is the biggest one among all the universities in our prefecture. Lots of students from other universities, even outside our prefecture come to see the show we put on. And it goes without saying that this is one of the most important events of Kansai University. So I hope you will understand the seriousness of the position I'm about to request one of you to undertake.

<p class="centered">The same girl sitting next to the girl Izumi ran into questions her.</p>

**Girl:** Which is?

**Aoki:** The assistant head volunteer.

<p class="centered">The students whisper amongst themselves.</p>

**Aoki:** So, is anyone up to the task?

<p class="centered">A student asks.</p>

**Student:** Isn't this an important role, shouldn't you be giving it to a third or fourth year?

**Aoki:** I should, but this isn't any other university. You can't get into Kansai being mediocre. So I want to give all of you a fair chance. Anyone who is interested, raise their hands.

<p class="centered">She closes her eyes and thinks to herself.</p>

**Aoki:** *(It would be nice to have a student from my own class be chosen for the position, so in case no one in the university is interested, I could at least let these guys know who the head is, maybe that would—)*

<p class="centered">She hears the sound of tables moving around and looks up. She is surprised to see a decent amount of people raising their hands.</p>

**Aoki:** Nice, so we have something to work with. *smiles* All of you write down your names on a sheet of paper and give it to…

<p class="centered">She looks around the classroom and her eyes settle on the first row.</p>

**Aoki:** You, what's your name?

<p class="centered">She points to Ms. Miyamoto.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Miyamoto Hitsumi.

**Aoki:** Oh, you're the one who got the top score in this class, am I correct?

**Hitsumi:** Yes, I'm pretty sure.

**Aoki:** Well, in that case, you will be the class representative. Collect the names of all the students and give it to me by the end of the day.

**Hitsumi:** Yes ma'am.

**Aoki:** Good, now, let's move on to the lesson.

<p class="centered">She moves to the digital board and starts writing.</p>

**Aoki:** Today, we're gonna be revising all the basics of physics you should've learnt in college, so let's start with motion.

<p class="centered">After 50 minutes pass.</p>

**Aoki:** And that's all for nanomaterials. The next class we'll start with quantum physics. That will take place in two hours. Until then you're free. Miyamoto take a note of all the names.

**Hitsumi:** Yes ma'am.

<p class="centered">She stands up and asks everyone to line up and come write their name on her paper. As the people line up causing chaos, she settles them down.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Single line, you there, stop trying to cut in.

**Aoki:** *smiles* *(Good leadership)* Find me in my room Miyamoto. I'm assuming you know where that is.

**Hitsumi:** Of course I do.

**Aoki:** Good.

<p class="centered">She walks out and all the students write down their names and she goes through it making sure everyone has written their names.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Alright.

**Girl:** Already the teacher's pet?

**Hitsumi:** Oh please, it's not like I want to do it. I'm only going through with it because my parents want me to take part in everything.

**Girl:** Interesting, so you're not a nerd, right?

**Hitsumi:** What do you think? *with a bland expression*

**Girl:** *smiles* You seem like fun, my name's Yurika Ino.

<p class="centered">She extends her hand. Hitsumi smiles and shakes it.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Nice to meet you.

<p class="centered">Meanwhile in the canteen.</p>

**Chloe:** It's pretty hard to get a hold of you.

<p class="centered">Izumi turns around surprised.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh Chloe, my bad, I forgot to hand you my number.

<p class="centered">She smiles and hands him her phone.</p>

**Chloe:** Never too late.

<p class="centered">He smiles and puts his number into her phone.</p>

**Izumi:** So should I save it boyfriend or baby?

**Chloe:** *laughs* Hold your horses cowboy. Izumi will do for now.

**Izumi:** You sure?

**Chloe:** Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

<p class="centered">He laughs and hands over her phone.</p>

**Chloe:** So when are you gonna take me out?

**Izumi:** What about later tomorrow?

**Chloe:** Sure, you better remember this time.

**Izumi:** Of course.

<p class="centered">She waves and walks away.</p>

**Chloe:** See you later Izumi.

<p class="centered">He waves back. Kenji comes from behind and puts his arms around his shoulders.</p>

**Kenji:** It seems like you and the blondie are getting along pretty well.

**Izumi:** Is that surprising?

**Kenji:** Not really. So, what are you planning to do about the thing with Ms. Aoki?

**Izumi:** *sighs* I don't know man. I don't really want to work.

**Kenji:** Understandable. Hopefully you get a good assistant.

**Izumi:** How does it even matter, I work better alone anyways.

**Kenji:** I know that, what I meant was, since you don't wanna work at all. You can just push all the work onto them.

**Izumi:** *thinks* That… sounds like a plan. *smiles* I completely forgot about that.

**Kenji:** It would be even better if it's a hot girl.

<p class="centered">Both of them smile as they rub their hands together.</p>

**Izumi:** As long as it's not a guy it would be bearable.

**Kenji:** Even an ugly girl?

**Izumi:** There aren't ugly girls in Kansai.

**Kenji:** Hypothetically.

**Izumi:** I'd rather not.

**Kenji:** I'm guessing you're gonna cut afternoon classes.

**Izumi:** Of course.

**Kenji:** And what are you gonna do?

**Izumi:** I don't know. I had a date with a girl, but I don't know why, I'm just don't feel like going.

**Kenji:** You? Don't feel like talking to a girl?

**Izumi:** It's not like that. I just wanna relax.

**Kenji:** A date is probably the most relaxing thing for you.

**Izumi:** Maybe so, but I haven't done anything active in a while. Wanna hoop later?

**Kenji:** *smiles* Wanna? Of course I do, how much we talking?

**Izumi:** Loser buys dinner.

**Kenji:** You're on.

<p class="centered">They smile as they walk towards the court.</p>

<p class="centered">In Aoki's Cabin. There's knocking outside her door.</p>

**Aoki:** Come in.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi walks in through the door.</p>

**Aoki:** Ah, Miyamoto, I'm guessing you're here to give me the list.

**Hitsumi:** Yes ma'am.

<p class="centered">She makes some space on her desk. Hitsumi walks over and gives her the paper.</p>

**Aoki:** Alright.

<p class="centered">She goes through the list as Hitsumi stands silently beside her.</p>

**Aoki:** So 28 out of 70 volunteered.

**Aoki:** Alright, inform them that I will hold an interview tomorrow after the afternoon class.

**Hitsumi:** I'll let them know.

**Aoki:** Thank you Miyamoto.

**Hitsumi:** You're welcome ma'am.

<p class="centered">Aoki pulls up her laptop to go through the student background of each of the names. As Hitsumi was going to walk out she turns around and asks a question.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Ma'am if you don't mind there's something I'd like to know.

**Aoki:** Sure.

**Hitsumi:** Who's the Head volunteer?

**Aoki:** It's Iz—

<p class="centered">She suddenly remembers as she was about to say it that, she was the girl who had an altercation with Izumi the other day.</p>

**Aoki:** *smiles* Actually, let it be a surprise.

**Hitsumi:** A surprise?

**Aoki:** Yes.

<p class="centered">Slightly confused, she lets go of it and proceeds to exit, but Aoki stops her beforehand.</p>

**Aoki:** Miyamoto, wait.

**Hitsumi:** Yes?

**Aoki:** How about this, I'm gonna interview you right now, and if you pass you get the role.

**Hitsumi:** Really? *excited*

**Aoki:** Yes.

**Hitsumi:** Alright, I'm ready.

**Aoki:** Alright Miyamoto, what's your reason for applying for this position?

**Hitsumi:** I feel like this would be an invaluable opportunity to learn how to manage events and coordinate people to get stuff done in an efficient manner. This is easily one of the biggest events in Japan, so if I can manage this, I should be able to manage anything, and this will add a lot to my resume.

**Aoki:** Alright, what makes you different from the rest?

**Hitsumi:** My strength is my genius-like adaptability. When a plan fails, I don't look for blame; I look for the fastest possible workaround and execute the pivot instantly. I don't get flustered, which means I can get a solution faster than the problem can grow and create chaos.

**Aoki:** Have you ever done something similar previously?

**Hitsumi:** Yes. In high school, I organized a large regional competition. We lost our main venue two days before the event. I handled the crisis—securing a replacement, rerouting logistics, and managing the team on the fly. We delivered the event successfully, on time and under budget.

**Aoki:** Good. Finally, *smiles* How compatible do you think you are with working alongside people who aren't very cooperative?

<p class="centered">Hitsumi replies slightly confused.</p>

**Hitsumi:** I'm highly compatible. My approach isn't to issue demands, but to lead the execution. When I delegate a task, I ensure the team has the resources and clarity to succeed, and I'm ready to jump into the details alongside them. My goal isn't just a friendly environment, but a productive one.

**Aoki:** That's good to hear. You may find that your new primary task won't be execution, but rather managing a highly intelligent variable whose primary goal is non-compliance.

**Hitsumi:** What do you mean?

**Aoki:** Your head, he might try to actively sabotage the event.

**Hitsumi:** WHAT? Then why is he even appointed for the job?

**Aoki:** I have my reasons, the question is are you up to the task?

<p class="centered">She replies confidently unaware of the situation she has just signed up for.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Of course. Dealing with opposition is a test of true management. I'll make sure he respects me and the event and does his best to make this a success.

<p class="centered">Aoki laughs after hearing that.</p>

**Aoki:** All the best with that then Ms. Miyamoto.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, you mean?

**Aoki:** Yes, you're selected.

**Hitsumi:** THANK YOU MA'AM.

<p class="centered">She bows down respectfully.</p>

**Aoki:** Don't worry about it, your real challenge starts now.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* Yes, I'll make sure you don't regret this decision.

**Aoki:** I'm sure I won't. Now get going. It's almost 9:30 PM, they're gonna close the dormitories.

<p class="centered">She comes back to reality and realizes how late she is.</p>

**Hitsumi:** OH, please excuse me ma'am.

<p class="centered">She hurries over to the door and exits her cabin.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Thank you again.

<p class="centered">Aoki smiles and leans back on her chair. She turns around and looks through her window.</p>

**Aoki:** This is gonna be quite a fest huh.

<p class="centered">As she looks out into the sky the POV switches to Haruto. He kicks a football towards a glass bottle shattering it to pieces.</p>

**Guy:** So what did Mr. Nanjou say?

**Haruto:** He told me to back off of Kurosaki.

**Guy 2:** What, why? I know he has done a lot, but he seems so weak?

<p class="centered">As Haruto grits his teeth, he remembers the conversation he had with Yusei in private.</p>

**Yusei:** Don't mess with that guy.

**Haruto:** Brother, I'm telling you, we can take him on.

**Yusei:** Take him on? *laughs insultingly* You'd be lucky to land a hit and leave with your life.

**Haruto:** Are we even talking about the same person?

**Yusei:** *sighs* You're right, we're not. What you saw yesterday was just a normal human. If you catch him on a good day you might beat him up a bit.

<p class="centered">He remembers what happened last year.</p>

**Yusei:** But, what I saw then, was anything but human.

**Haruto:** *confused* I don't get it. You're the biggest guy in the university, everyone listens to you, even the teachers are afraid of you. Then why are you so wary of that scrawny guy?

**Yusei:** Listen Haruto, as long as you bully him, poke a few jokes, or even go as far as hitting him a couple times you're good. But I know you. As you grow tired of doing the same thing and him smiling through everything you're gonna get mad and find another way to annoy him. And that way will surely be to go after the people he cares about.

**Haruto:** *smiles with malice* And what's the problem with that?

**Yusei:** The problem is, as long as you go after him, he will deal with it.

<p class="centered">He walks close to Haruto.</p>

**Yusei:** But the moment you go after the people he loves…

<p class="centered">He looks him in the eyes; dead serious.</p>

**Yusei:** You will regret it.

<p class="centered">Haruto steps back slightly scared.</p>

**Haruto:** Fine, fine, I won't.

**Yusei:** Good, don't forget it, DON'T mess with Kurosaki.

<p class="centered">He kicks another ball into another glass.</p>

**Haruto:** I don't know.

<p class="centered">Slowly his frown turns into a sly smile.</p>

**Haruto:** I'm sorry brother, but I can't listen to you. I refuse to believe he's that strong.

**Girl:** So what are you gonna do about him?

**Haruto:** Just wait, we will strike soon enough.

<p class="centered">A rooster crows as the next day rolls around. Izumi gets up from his bed half asleep. He brushes his teeth. Takes a bath. Puts on his classic outfit. Finally puts on his black denim jacket. Then he meets with Kenji and they walk to class.</p>

**Kenji:** You coming to class today?

**Izumi:** Of course not.

**Kenji:** Figured.

**Izumi:** I'll just walk with you till class and go sleep somewhere or something.

**Kenji:** You have a date today right, with Chloe?

**Izumi:** Oh yeah, that too, hopefully nothing pops up today.

<p class="centered">As they are walking to class they get cut off.</p>

**???:** Good morning Kurosaki.

<p class="centered">He gets scared and turns around hoping it's not who he thinks it is.</p>

**Izumi:** *awkward smile* Good morning Ms. Aoki.

**Aoki:** Where are you headed?

**Izumi:** Class, where else.

**Aoki:** I believe your friend is going to class, but are you?

**Izumi:** Sure I am.

<p class="centered">She looks at him doubtfully.</p>

**Izumi:** Maybe not?

**Aoki:** Good, follow me.

**Izumi:** What, why should I—

<p class="centered">Cuts to both of them standing outside her class.</p>

**Aoki:** Stay out.

<p class="centered">He sighs and stands outside looking out into the center of the academic block at students playing football. Inside, the students greet Ms. Aoki.</p>

**Students:** Good morning Ms. Aoki.

**Aoki:** Good morning students. Today I won't be taking class, just revise everything we learnt about quantum mechanics yesterday.

<p class="centered">The students celebrate the free period.</p>

**Aoki:** Ms. Miyamoto. Meet me outside.

<p class="centered">She gets caught off guard but agrees and walks out with her.</p>

**Hitsumi:** What's the matter Ms. Aoki?

**Aoki:** You wanted to know who's your head right?

<p class="centered">Izumi hears them and turns around to look at them as she signals towards him.</p>

**Aoki:** Meet your head, Kurosaki Izumi. Kurosaki meet your assistant volunteer Miyamoto Hitsumi.

<p class="centered">As they look at each other the calm before the storm ensues.</p>
