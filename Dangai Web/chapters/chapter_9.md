
**Sora:** Inazuchi Raiga, what is the meaning of this?

**Raiga:** Captain, I was just fighting this thug like I'm supposed to.

<p class="centered">He turns towards Raiga</p>

**Sora:** Thug? That’s Izumi.

**Raiga:** Yeah, *thinks* OHH WAIT, THAT’S WHERE I REMEMBER HIM FROM. He is the guy you were talking about yesterday.

**Sora:** *glares at him* Yes, and he’s the guy you were fighting in the middle of the city, letting the actual thugs escape.

**Raiga:** (confused) Huh?

<p class="centered">He looks around and realizes that, amongst all the chaos, the other thugs have all run away. Raiga looks back at Sora with a sorry face and smiles innocently. Sora glares him down, and he yelps. Raiga goes to Izumi and instantly changes personalities</p>

**Raiga:** *smiles* Hey Izumi, I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance, I hope we can be good friends.* grins*

<p class="centered">He shakes his hand furiously</p>

**Izumi:** Ok, Ok, Chill.

**Sora:** *sighs* I'm sorry for the commotion, Izumi. What were you doing here anyway?

**Izumi:** Oh, we saw smoke -

**Hitsumi:** We saw smoke and thought we could help.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at her pissed off</p>

**Izumi:** Now you decide to come forward.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles*

**Izumi:** Bitch…

**Hitsumi:** Did you say something?

**Izumi:** Nothing, nothing at all. *smiles*

**Hitsumi:** Good. *smiles* By the way what are you gonna do about your katana?

**Izumi:** (confused) What do you mean?

<p class="centered">She points towards his hand holding the katana. He looks down and realizes it has crumbled to pieces.</p>

**Izumi:** HUH? (he exclaims)

<p class="centered">He lets go of the handle, and the entire thing turns to dust</p>

**Izumi:** Did I go that hard?

**Sora:** It seems you did, after all, that’s just a regular wooden katana.

**Izumi:** You’re right. I guess I poured too much of my spirit into it by mistake. *(My resonance is too rusty.)*

**Sora:** Your spirit? You have that high a blood purity?

**Izumi:** What do you mean?

**Sora:** You need to have quite a lot of angel blood to break a weapon from spirit overflow.

**Izumi:** I could’ve been using my own spirit?

**Sora:** Your own?

<p class="centered">Izumi realizes he said something wrong.</p>

**Izumi:** *(These guys don’t know about spirits?)* *mildly flustered* Oh, uh, yeah, I meant I just got too spirited and put too much force on it, besides, it’s just a wooden blade.

**Sora:** Oh, you did seem pretty into it. Next time, just try to keep it off the middle of the city.

**Izumi:** *scratches his head and laughs* Yeah, will do.

**Sora:** Are you guys free today?

**Izumi:** Yeah, I guess.

**Sora:** *smiles* Fine, follow me.

**Izumi:** Okay.

<p class="centered">The three of them start following Sora and walking away</p>

**Raiga:** *laughs* I can’t lie, man, you’re pretty fast.

<p class="centered">As he pats him on the back, pushing him forward a bit</p>

**Izumi:** *laughs awkwardly* Yeah, and you’re pretty strong.

<p class="centered">As Raiga laughs, Sora gets lost in thought as he looks at Izumi’s sword</p>

**Sora:** *(That feeling, that aura emanating from his sword, it felt so similar to that time)*

<p class="centered">In his memories</p>

<p class="centered">Sora screams as a blueish white aura envelops him, and his sword glows in a similar way to his.</p>

<p class="centered">He looks up at a demon holding Shizuka by the neck.</p>

**Sora:** SHIZUKAA!!

**Izumi:** Sora?

<p class="centered">He continues to be lost in his mind</p>

**Izumi:** Sora?

<p class="centered">Izumi taps Sora on the shoulder.</p>

**Izumi:** Sora?

**Sora:** Huh?

<p class="centered">He snaps back to reality.</p>

**Izumi:** Where are we going?

**Sora:** Oh, sorry, I was lost in thought. We’re going to our base.

**Raiga:** *shocked* You sure, Captain?

**Sora:** Relax, Raiga, we can trust them. *smiles*

**Izumi:** *(He doesn’t mean that)*

**Hitsumi:** *(He doesn’t mean that)*

<p class="centered">They walk for a few minutes</p>

**Sora:** So, Izumi, where were you before yesterday?

**Izumi:** *gulps* What? (So much for trusting us.)

**Sora:** I just mean, I would’ve heard about someone strong enough to go toe to toe with Raiga.

**Raiga:** Hey, I wasn’t going all out, okay.

<p class="centered">Sora looks at Raiga with an uninterested face</p>

**Raiga:** Ok, I'll shut up, (with a sad face)

<p class="centered">He looks back towards Izumi</p>

**Izumi:** Uhhh, well.

**Hitsumi:** We are actually from a few sectors away.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at her, shocked and confused</p>

**Sora:** Oh, which sector?

**Hitsumi:** Sector-C.

**Sora:** Interesting, what brings you here?

**Hitsumi:** We’re just wandering travellers. We got bored with staying in the same place.

**Sora:** Mmm *closes his eyes and thinks*.

**Sora:** *(She seems to be telling the truth.)*

**Izumi:** *(Wow, I would’ve believed her if I didn’t know better.)*

**Sora:** How long do you guys plan on staying?

<p class="centered">He looks at Izumi, and Izumi turns to Hitsumi</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Do I have to do everything myself?)*

**Izumi:** *(You’re the one who started the lie.)*

**Hitsumi:** *(*sighs*)*

<p class="centered">She looks towards Sora</p>

**Hitsumi:** We’re not sure. This place seems nice, so we will probably stay for a while.

**Sora:** That’s good to hear.

<p class="centered">Raiga stops and looks at Sora. Sora nods. He turns towards Izumi and Hitsumi</p>

**Sora:** We have arrived.

<p class="centered">They look around, confused.</p>

**Hitsumi:** This is just an alleyway.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at what seems to be a dead end and smiles</p>

**Sora:** (looks at Izumi) It seems you have noticed. I wouldn’t expect anything less.

<p class="centered">Izumi walks towards a wooden wall at the end of the alley and stands in front of it for some time. He smiles and walks through it, surprising Hitsumi</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Ehhh)*

<p class="centered">Sora and Raiga walk towards it and turn around to invite Hitsumi in. She hesitates, then walks towards the wall. She takes a deep breath and places her hand on the wall as it passes through. She then moves forward and phases through the wall to the other side. She is met with what seems to be a secret base with a huge staircase in the middle leading up to the second floor, and doors leading to rooms all around. A chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling. Grey walls surround the place, making it look like an old castle, with a red carpet leading the way.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Wow, this place looks amazing.

**Izumi:** I know, right? Considering it was hidden behind a wall, I thought it would be much smaller.

**Sora:** Welcome to our base of operations, I guess you could say.

<p class="centered">A bunch of squad members standing around bow and welcome them.</p>

**Member 1:** Welcome back, Captain.

**Member 2:** Welcome back, Captain.

**Member 3:** Welcome back, Captain.

**Member 4:** Welcome back, Captain.

**Member 5:** Welcome back, Captain.

**Member 6:** Welcome back, Captain.

**Member 7:** Welcome back, Captain.

<p class="centered">And a few more. He raises his hand, and they stand back up and continue their work.</p>

**Izumi:** Damn, how many people you have over here.

**Sora:** We have close to 670 members right now, but this isn’t the safest job around, so the members fluctuate often.

**Izumi:** I'm sorry.

**Sora:** It’s fine.

<p class="centered">As he looks around, he suddenly gets a bad feeling, and his face becomes serious.</p>

**Izumi:** *(Something's off, I have a bad feeling about this.)*

<p class="centered">As he looks around, a person jumps on him from the top of the chandelier behind him.</p>

**Shion:** IZUMIIII !!!!

<p class="centered">He looks over his shoulder and notices her coming towards him, and moves out of the way. She crashes into the ground face-first. She stands up and turns towards him</p>

**Shion:** Aww, Izumiii, you’re so mean.

**Sora:** Shion, that’s not how we greet our guests.

**Shion:** Yes, yes, I'm sorry.

<p class="centered">Shizuka walks down the stairs.</p>

**Shizuka:** Welcome Izumi, Hitsumi.

**Izumi:** Hey Shizuka.

**Hitsumi:** Hi Shizuka.

<p class="centered">Shion starts jumping around again.</p>

**Shion:** WHY DOES EVERYONE ONLY LIKE HER?

**Izumi:** *giggles*

**Shizuka:** Would you like me to get you anything to drink?

<p class="centered">Izumi’s eyes glow</p>

**Izumi:** I mean, I'm pretty tired from the fight, I don’t really wanna lift a glass.

**Shizuka:** If you would like, I could get someone to assist you with that.

**Izumi:** Assist? You mean like feed me?

**Shizuka:** Yes.

**Izumi:** Like a girl?

**Shizuka:** If you would like.

**Izumi:** *grins* In that case, I’ll take a

<p class="centered">Hitsumi elbows him in the stomach</p>

**Hitsumi:** *clears her throat* he meant to say we don’t need anything.

**Izumi:** *(*crying* You could’ve just said that.)*

**Sora:** *laughs* Come, let me walk you around.

<p class="centered">He gives them a tour around the base of common places like the barracks, kitchen, utilities, bathrooms, dormitory for members, etc. He then takes them to the living quarters and shows them all the rooms</p>

**Sora:** This is my room. Pretty plain and simple, I know.

**Hitsumi:** Wow, there's not even a single picture or anything.

**Izumi:** This looks nice.

**Sora:** Really?

**Izumi:** I like simple spaces.

**Sora:** I’ll take that as a compliment.

<p class="centered">Then he shows them Shizuka’s room.</p>

**Izumi:** This is pretty neat as well.

**Sora:** She tries to keep it well-maintained.

<p class="centered">Then he shows them Raiga’s room. It's filled with posters of warriors from the past of Dangai</p>

**Izumi:** Damn, he really likes fighting huh.

**Sora:** Yeah, he can be a bit… aggressive at times. But he is a nice guy.

**Izumi:** Uh-huh.

<p class="centered">They go to another room. It's filled with swords and relics.</p>

**Izumi:** A swordsman, huh?

**Sora:** Yes, He is Tsukihara Kuroya.

<p class="centered">Izumi lays his eyes on a Katana and wakizashi, and goes over towards it with a glimmer in his eyes. He takes them and starts looking in the mirror</p>

**Izumi:** Ahh, it's been so long since I held dual katanas.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi walks over and knocks him on the head</p>

**Hitsumi:** Don’t touch others' things without permission.

**Izumi:** *rubbing his head with a tear in his eye* I'm sorry.

**Sora:** It's fine, Kuroya usually doesn’t mind as long as no one touches his sword.

<p class="centered">He looks over to a katana kept on a pedestal</p>

**Hitsumi:** Don’t encourage him.

**Sora:** *smiles* I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

<p class="centered">Izumi hands her the swords.</p>

**Izumi:** Here, you try holding them.

**Hitsumi:** What? Me?

**Izumi:** Yeah.

**Hitsumi:** It's fine.

**Izumi:** Just try it.

**Sora:** It's alright, really.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs* fine.

<p class="centered">She takes the swords and swings them around.</p>

**Sora:** Wow, do you usually use dual katanas?

**Hitsumi:** What? No no. This is actually my first time holding actual katanas.

**Sora:** Really? You seem to be a natural.

**Hitsumi:** You think so?

<p class="centered">She looks over towards Izumi.</p>

**Izumi:** *smiles* *(just like her, huh).*

<p class="centered">She takes a defensive stance.</p>

**Izumi:** What?

**Hitsumi:** Come at me.

**Izumi:** *laughs* Alright, man, just because you can swing swords around doesn’t mean you can fight me.

**Hitsumi:** Sounds like someone is scared.

**Izumi:** *sighs* I guess I am.

<p class="centered">He walks outside the room.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Whatt? You’re no fun.

<p class="centered">She keeps the katanas back in their place and walks out. They walk over to the next room. It has RGB lights all around and is filled with posters of half-naked men and women. It has shelves filled with manga and a full computer setup</p>

**Sora:** And this is-

**Izumi:** *(I can guess).*

**Hitsumi:** *(I can guess).*

**Shion:** WELCOME TO MY ROOM.

<p class="centered">Izumi sighs</p>

**Sora:** Shion, don’t shout. (disappointedly)

**Shion:** OKAYYY.

<p class="centered">Sora sighs. Shion creeps up behind Izumi</p>

**Shion:** So what do you think?

**Izumi:** It’s a room, that’s for sure.

**Shion:** *puffs her face* That’s so simple.

<p class="centered">She moves over behind Hitsumi.</p>

**Shion:** What about you?

<p class="centered">She looks around surprised.</p>

**Hitsumi:** How did u get all of this?

**Shion:** *smiles widely* Hehe, it’s a secret.

**Izumi:** *(She is right, how did she get access to so many things from Earth.)*

<p class="centered">Izumi walks over and inspects the items.</p>

**Izumi:** *(These manga are from Earth, even the games on this setup are connected to Earth servers, despite the time disparity between the two realms.)*

<p class="centered">Shion walks over to Izumi.</p>

**Shion:** *smiles* You seem to have spotted something you like.

<p class="centered">He turns around and looks at her.</p>

**Izumi:** How did you get all these? They’re definitely from Earth.

<p class="centered">She shakes her head and raises her hands.</p>

**Shion:** I just said, didn’t I? It’s a secret.

**Izumi:** Just say it, man.

**Shion:** *sighs* Fine, but you have to do something for me as well.

<p class="centered">She drags her finger down Izumi’s chest.</p>

**Sora:** Shion, don’t sexually assault our guests.

<p class="centered">She steps back.</p>

**Shion:** Whatt? Boring.

**Sora:** I think we can move to the next room.

<p class="centered">They all move out.</p>

**Shion:** Alright, I’ll come as well. (enthusiastically)

**Sora:** Alright, that should conclude the tour.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks over at the room at the end of the corridor with a dark aura emanating from it.</p>

**Izumi:** And whose room is that?

**Sora:** Oh, that.

<p class="centered">He makes an uninterested face. Izumi looks at him confused.</p>

**Sora:** That is Yamikage’s room.

**Izumi:** We aren’t gonna see that?

**Sora:** He doesn’t really like it when people visit him.

**Izumi:** Oh, alright.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi looks at it with suspicion. Izumi calls out to her</p>

**Izumi:** Hey, Hitsumi, we are going.

<p class="centered">She turns around surprised.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Oh, ok, hold up.

<p class="centered">She catches up with them, and they make their way to a conference room. There is a council table at the centre of the room, with windows behind the captain's chair, looking out into the city.</p>

**Sora:** Izumi:

**Izumi:** Yes.

**Sora:** Different Gokurengumi squads of different sectors have their own form of leadership. However, the most prevalent one is a group of people who stand at the top of the food chain and assist the captain.

<p class="centered">He walks over and takes a seat at the Captain's chair. Shizuka stands behind him to his left</p>

**Sora:** Shizuka.

**Shizuka:** Yes Captain.

**Sora:** Assemble the Gokurensho.

**Shizuka:** Yes Captain.

<p class="centered">She keeps her fingers on her ear, similar to what Izumi did at the beginning. She sends out a message in a serious voice.</p>

**Shizuka:** Gokurensho, assemble at the conference room.

<p class="centered">Within a few seconds, with a gust of wind, the room is filled with people sitting in their chairs</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(So fast)*

<p class="centered">A guy with a very formal posture speaks up</p>

**???:** Why have you assembled us here, Captain?

<p class="centered">He glances at Hitsumi and Izumi with a judgmental look</p>

**???:** And who are they, and what are they doing in here?

<p class="centered">Sora smiles</p>

**Sora:** So particular as always, Tsukihara. (Tsukihara Kuroya)

**Kuroya:** It’s good to be thorough.

**Sora:** Indeed, *exhales*. I’ve brought you all here today for an important discussion.

<p class="centered">They all look at him with some interest, and some with excitement.</p>

**Sora:** And it also has to do with why these two are here.

<p class="centered">Kuroya raises an eyebrow.</p>

**Sora:** But first, it seems we’re missing a member.

<p class="centered">He looks over at an empty chair and then at Shizuka</p>

**Shizuka:** He still hasn’t returned from his previous mission, Captain.

**Sora:** *sighs* He really should stop going off on so many solo expeditions.

<p class="centered">Sora smiles and leans forward, joining his hands to support his face</p>

**Sora:** Fine, it seems we will have to do this voting without him.

**Hitsumi:** *(Voting?)*

**Izumi:** *(I don’t have a good feeling about this)*

**Raiga:** Captain, you can't mean.

<p class="centered">He leans back and stands up, and supports himself against the table</p>

**Sora:** All in favour of Izumi and Hitsumi joining the Gokurengumi.

**Kuroya:** *sighs* Why do you need a conference for recruiting newbies?

**Sora:** *smiles* As a part of the Gokurensho.

<p class="centered">Raiga gets shocked. Shizuka remains emotionless with a hint of a smile. Shion smiles widely with excitement. Kuroya slams the desk and stands up</p>

**Kuroya:** Captain, you have to be joking.

**Sora:** I'm as serious as can be.

<p class="centered">Kuroya gets furious</p>

**Kuroya:** We can't let random people into the highest posting there is.

**Sora:** Izumi wields both blade and mind with great precision.

**Kuroya:** Just because he excels at combat and strategy, it doesn’t mean we should allow him in without understanding his personality or background.

<p class="centered">The conversation starts to become more heated and turns into a debate.</p>

**Sora:** *sighs* He let himself get hurt to protect a friend.

**Kuroya:** That’s for a friend. How can you guarantee he will do the same for a civilian?

**Sora:** He ran into a fiery building to save people for no reason, so why would he not do the same as one of us?

<p class="centered">He turns towards Raiga with a stern look.</p>

**Sora:** Right, Inazuchi.

<p class="centered">He gets caught off guard and stutters</p>

**Raiga:** Uh, yes, yes, he did.

<p class="centered">He turns back towards Kuroya.</p>

**Kuroya:** *gnashes his teeth*.

<p class="centered">He sits back down</p>

**Kuroya:** Do as you wish.

**Hitsumi:** *(Such a bitch)*

**Sora:** Alright, let's proceed with the voting then.

<p class="centered">Sora also takes a seat</p>

**Kuroya:** I'm against it.

**Shion:** I'M ALL FOR IT.

**Kuroya:** Why?

**Shion:** *grins and looks at Izumi* I have my reasons.

**Kuroya:** *sighs*

**Sora:** Inazuchi, what about you?

**Raiga:** I don’t know, Captain. Tsukihara also made good points.

**Kuroya:** Finally.

**Raiga:** But he is strong, and he did try to help the people.

**Kuroya:** Inazuchi.

<p class="centered">He scratches his head out of indecision</p>

**Raiga:** Ahhh, fine. I'm choosing not to vote.

**Kuroya:** *facepalms*.

**Sora:** Interesting. Well, I choose to let him in.

<p class="centered">They all look toward Shizuka.</p>

**Sora:** If you say no, it's 2 for 2, and the voting will not be unanimous.

**Kuroya:** Shizuka, make the right choice.

<p class="centered">Shizuka takes a moment to think. She remembers the smile on Sora’s face when he was talking about Izumi. She takes a deep breath.</p>

**Shizuka:** I vote…

<p class="centered">They all look at her with eager eyes</p>

**Shizuka:** To let them join.

**Sora:** *smiles* Perfect, you guys can start tomorrow.

**Kuroya:** Tsk.

<p class="centered">Shizuka smiles</p>

**Shion:** Yayyy. Aren’t you happy, Izumi?

<p class="centered">She jumps toward Izumi. He dodges her, and she falls on the floor. She turns around and gets surprised, looking at the serious look on his face. He looks up and smiles</p>

**Izumi:** That’s crazy, guys, great and all, but.

<p class="centered">Everyone looks at him confused.</p>

**Izumi:** I never agreed to join.

<p class="centered">They all look at him, shocked.</p>

**Kuroya:** You’re rejecting the opportunity to join the Gokurensho, coming straight from the captain?

**Izumi:** Yes-

**Hitsumi:** NO.

<p class="centered">He looks at her, confused</p>

**Izumi:** What do you mean?

<p class="centered">She pulls his arm and whispers in his ear.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Are you out of your mind?

**Izumi:** Are you out of yours?

**Hitsumi:** This is a great opportunity.

**Izumi:** To die.

**Hitsumi:** You won't die.

**Izumi:** You will.

<p class="centered">She lets go of his arm. He fixes his jacket</p>

**Sora:** Izumi, what is the meaning of this?

<p class="centered">He looks at him</p>

**Izumi:** I'm not letting Hitsumi join the Gokurensho.

<p class="centered">He thinks for some time and walks towards Izumi</p>

**Sora:** Fine, I get it, she doesn’t know how to fight.

<p class="centered">He walks past Izumi as Izumi looks down with an emotionless face</p>

**Sora:** She can join as a regular worker, a maid or something, that way she won’t get hurt.

<p class="centered">He turns around</p>

**Sora:** Then you can join the Gokurensho worry-free. And I’ll make sure you get paid handsomely for the mission you go on.

<p class="centered">He comes closer to his ears.</p>

**Sora:** What do you say?

**Hitsumi:** Come on, Izumi, it will be fun.

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles and looks up. He starts laughing</p>

**Izumi:** You think you can buy me with money?

<p class="centered">Izumi turns around. Sora steps back, shocked.</p>

**Izumi:** I thought you would be up to something like this when you invited us into your base and gave us a tour.

<p class="centered">He walks over towards him.</p>

**Izumi:** I'm sorry, man, I'm sure you’re a great guy, and I'm sure this is a great position, but I'm not interested.

<p class="centered">He walks past him and keeps his hand on his shoulder</p>

**Izumi:** Good luck finding someone else to fill that seat for you. But don’t get your hopes up.

<p class="centered">He whispers in his ear</p>

**Izumi:** He won’t be as good as me.

<p class="centered">He lets go of his shoulder and continues forward out of the room</p>

**Izumi:** Come on, we’re leaving.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi puffs her face out of anger and disappointment, but finally walks out behind him and apologizes to Sora and the rest of the people. Sora smiles and turns around</p>

**Sora:** You really think I'm just gonna let you walk out of my base?

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles without turning back to look at him. Sora looks over his shoulder at everyone else. Raiga pulls out his axe and gets ready for a rematch. Shion pulls out a scythe and smiles as she licks the blade. Shizuka stands back</p>

**Kuroya:** *(I guess this will be a good time to test his skills)*

<p class="centered">Kuroya stands up</p>

**Kuroya:** Fine, I’ll bite.

<p class="centered">He pulls out a katana.</p>

**Kuroya:** *(No way he can fight all of us at once, there’s no chance)*

<p class="centered">He looks at Izumi, focusing on every small move he makes.</p>

**Kuroya:** *(So, Izumi, what will be your move?)*

<p class="centered">Sora looks back at Izumi and grins as he keeps his hand on his katana, ready to unsheathe it. Hitsumi looks at Izumi with a worried face. Izumi smiles and looks over his shoulder.</p>

**Izumi:** Yes.

<p class="centered">Kuroya looks at him confused.</p>

**Izumi:** I think you’re gonna let me walk out, cause you don’t want to fight here, do you?

<p class="centered">The black aura flows from him and fills the room. Kuroya’s eyes widen in disbelief.</p>

**Kuroya:** *(What is this Sakai?)*

<p class="centered">He struggles to stand a bit, but still stands up straight.</p>

**Kuroya:** *(That’s not it, this isn’t even his Sakai.)*

<p class="centered">He looks up at him</p>

**Kuroya:** *(This is just from his glance… Impossible.)*

<p class="centered">Raiga gnashes his teeth to get ready for a fight</p>

**Raiga:** *(This is the same feeling as back then)*

<p class="centered">He looks at his hand</p>

**Raiga:** *(No, this is stronger. I can barely manage to hold onto my axe.)*

<p class="centered">Shion smiles in excitement and gets ready to jump at him</p>

**Shion:** *(Finally, I can get a piece of that.)*

<p class="centered">Izumi turns forward again.</p>

**Kuroya:** *(He’s just gonna walk out with almost the entire Gokurengumi ready to jump him)*

<p class="centered">He grabs Hitsumi by her arm and takes another step towards the exit. As he takes the step, Shion jumps at him, ready to cut him down. Sora raises his hand, and Shion stops in her tracks. Izumi continues to walk out with Hitsumi.</p>

**Shion:** Captain, why did you stop me? He’s leaving.

<p class="centered">Sora smiles.</p>

**Sora:** Let him go. Besides, if I didn’t stop you. You would’ve lost.

<p class="centered">Shion looks down, depressed, but then smiles again even harder.</p>

**Shion:** That gets me more excited for when I get to fight him.

**Sora:** Don’t worry, *smiles*, you’ll get there soon.

<p class="centered">He looks out of the balcony and sees them walk out of the base. Izumi notices him looking at him and smiles.</p>

**Kuroya:** *(What was that? Who is he? He walks away with his back turned towards the strongest fighters in the sector.)*

**Sora:** You will join soon enough, Izumi.

<p class="centered">He turns around and walks towards his room.</p>

**Sora:** Soon enough.

<p class="centered">The rest of the members walk out of the room.</p>

**Sora:** GOKURENSHO, MEETING’S OVER, DISPERSE.

<p class="centered">They start going to their rooms.</p>

**Sora:** Shizuka.

**Shizuka:** Yes Captain.

**Sora:** I need your help with something.

**Shizuka:** Is it related to Izumi?

**Sora:** *smiles* Yes.
