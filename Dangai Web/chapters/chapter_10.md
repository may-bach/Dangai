
<p class="centered">Hitsumi takes her hand away from Izumi</p>

**Hitsumi:** What was that about?

**Izumi:** I can't grab your hand?

**Hitsumi:** Not that. Why did you turn them down?

**Izumi:** *sighs* As I said, not interested.

**Hitsumi:** What does that even mean?

**Izumi:** What do you think?

**Hitsumi:** *gets pissed off* What else are you gonna do? Sit on your ass all day?

**Izumi:** I can cook.

**Hitsumi:** That’s besides the point.

**Izumi:** I don’t think it is.

**Hitsumi:** Shut up.

**Izumi:** Okay.

**Hitsumi:** You wanted to help people earlier, but why don’t you want to now?

**Izumi:** I don’t like working under others.

**Hitsumi:** It's Sora, he loves you, he will probably let you do whatever you want.

**Izumi:** *sighs* Why do you want me to do this anyway?

**Hitsumi:** Cause it will be fun, and also I'll get to work in a palace.

**Izumi:** as a maid.

**Hitsumi:** I don’t care.

**Izumi:** *exhales* I think you’re forgetting why we came here. We’re only going to stay here for a while. Then we have to start moving towards O-Ten again, it makes no sense to join them.

**Hitsumi:** I guess you do have a point.

**Izumi:** I always do.

**Hitsumi:** Shut up.

**Izumi:** Okay.

<p class="centered">They laugh and make their way back to the restaurant</p>

**Izumi:** Heyyy Reinaaa.

<p class="centered">Reina turns around from the middle of taking an order and runs over towards Izumi.</p>

**Reina:** IZUMI. ARE YOU OKAY?

<p class="centered">She inspects his arms, legs and body.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Damn, get a room you two.

**Izumi:** *laughs*.

**Reina:** I heard that you got into a fight. Are you hurt?

**Izumi:** Nah, I'm good.

**Hitsumi:** You only heard about the thugs; you didn’t hear the part when he almost started a fight with the entire Gokurensho.

**Reina:** Oh.

<p class="centered">She thinks for some time and turns towards Izumi and screams</p>

**Reina:** YOU DID WHAT!

**Izumi:** Chill, relax, nothing transpired.

**Reina:** Still, why are you going around picking fights with the Gokurensho?

**Izumi:** It’s not like I wanted to; if anything, they are the ones who were about to start.

**Reina:** About to start? So nothing happened.

**Izumi:** Yes.

**Reina:** *sighs* Still, what did you do?

**Izumi:** I-

**Hitsumi:** He refused a direct request from the captain to join the Gokurensho.

**Reina:** WHAT?

**Izumi:** I have my reasons, okay.

**Reina:** Makes sense, there’s no need to risk your life if you don’t want to.

<p class="centered">Her face becomes sad, but she does her best to hide it</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi yawns</p>

**Izumi:** It's already 6 o’clock, huh? Alright, I’m gonna take a nap. Wake me up at like 8 for dinner.

<p class="centered">He walks over to his room</p>

**Reina:** Did you also fight Hitsumi?

**Hitsumi:** Nono, I don’t think I'm ready for that yet.

**Izumi:** Correct.

<p class="centered">Izumi agrees from all the way upstairs</p>

**Hitsumi:** (gets angry) This piece of shit.

<p class="centered">She walks over towards the room</p>

**Hitsumi:** I’ll talk to you later, Reina.

**Reina:** Oh, okay, take care.

<p class="centered">She walks upstairs and kicks open the door</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi leaps up from the bed.</p>

**Izumi:** What's your problem? I just laid down.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi walks up to him.</p>

**Hitsumi:** You don’t want to risk your life?

**Izumi:** What?

**Hitsumi:** Doesn’t seem like something you’d agree with.

**Izumi:** What are you talking about?

**Hitsumi:** Why do you not want to join the Gokurensho?

**Izumi:** *sighs* As I said, we’re only gonna be here for a while.

**Hitsumi:** But for as long as we are, why can’t you join? You can just leave afterwards.

**Izumi:** Why are you so adamant about this?

**Hitsumi:** I wanna see you fight.

**Izumi:** Why?

**Hitsumi:** It's fun.

**Izumi:** *sighs* Even if I were to go on a mission, I'm not taking you with me.

**Hitsumi:** WHY?

**Izumi:** Why do you think?

**Hitsumi:** *sighs* I promise I won't get hurt. I’ll stay hidden.

**Izumi:** Why do you want to do this so bad?

**Hitsumi:** Cause... I also wanna learn how to fight.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks up at her, confused.</p>

**Izumi:** You.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi nods her head.</p>

**Izumi:** Wanna learn?

<p class="centered">Hitsumi nods her head.</p>

**Izumi:** How to fight?

<p class="centered">Hitsumi nods her head.</p>

**Izumi:** *laughs* You’re just an earthling, what makes you think you can fight people from Dangai? You won’t stand a chance.

**Hitsumi:** That’s not for you to decide.

**Izumi:** Well, I'm the one responsible for you, so it kinda is up to me to decide.

**Hitsumi:** How are you responsible for me?

**Izumi:** I'm the one who brought you here. Earthlings aren’t allowed in Dangai. For which there are multiple reasons. One of which is the fact that you are much weaker than an average human.

<p class="centered">She looks down in defeat.</p>

**Izumi:** 45 kmph, that’s the fastest an earthling can run. The average speed I’d say a human moves with is about the speed of sound on Earth. If you punch a rock, with enough training, you’ll be able to break it, whereas a human has enough attack power to level a building with a punch.

<p class="centered">He keeps his hand on her shoulder.</p>

**Izumi:** I'm sorry. But helping me by fighting was never an option; you have to find a different way. You will never be stronger than me.

<p class="centered">She pushes his hand off her shoulder and walks out of the room in silence.</p>

**Izumi:** *(Did I go a bit too hard on her?)*

<p class="centered">After thinking for some time</p>

**Izumi:** *(Eh, whatever.)*

<p class="centered">He goes to take a nap. Hitsumi walks towards the back door.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Who does he think he is?)*

<p class="centered">She walks out of the restaurant and into the backyard, and remembers what he said.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(That piece of shit, what does he know.)*

<p class="centered">She kicks a stone on the floor and hurts herself. She silently sits down on the wooden floorboard next to the building. After sitting for an hour, she looks at the grass and spots a stick. She walks over and picks it up, wiping a tear from her face. She starts swinging it around. After some time, she ends up swinging it so hard that the stick breaks into two against the air. She throws it on the ground and screams out of anger. Reina walks in on her</p>

**Reina:** Um, Hitsumi?

<p class="centered">She turns around, wiping all the tears off her face</p>

**Hitsumi:** Yes.

**Reina:** If you want to practice swordplay, I have a few spare swords from the ones I tried to get made for Izumi. If you want, of course.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* Oh yeah, that would be great.

**Reina:** Alright, I’ll get it for you tomorrow. For now, come and eat dinner.

**Hitsumi:** Yeah, let me just wash my face first.

<p class="centered">She goes to wash her face and looks at herself in the mirror. She hears Izumi’s words in her head again</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(I’ll show him. I swear I’ll get stronger, Strong enough to beat him, Strong enough to help him)*

<p class="centered">She walks out and sits at a table</p>

**Reina:** So tell me, Ms. Miyamoto,*smiles* what would you like to eat?

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* I’ll just take whatever I had yesterday. Hopefully, today there won’t be a side of flying beer bottles.

**Reina:** *giggles* Yeah, I don’t think they’re gonna come around for some time.

<p class="centered">After some time, she gets her food and eats it. She looks outside on the road as she sees people passing and looks around the place, seeing people enjoying their meal with their friends.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(It's been a long time since I ate by myself, huh, and I haven’t eaten anything since last night either.)*

<p class="centered">She keeps her hand on her stomach</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Strange, I don’t really feel that hungry either.)*

<p class="centered">She looks up and takes another bite of her food</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Probably something to do with this place)*

<p class="centered">She realizes something.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Wait, if my body is changing the longer I spend time here, doesn’t that mean I should also become stronger the more time I spend here?)*

<p class="centered">She grins hopefully.</p>

**Reina:** What's got you smiling?

**Hitsumi:** Oh, nothing, the food was really good.

**Reina:** Thanks, would you like seconds?

**Hitsumi:** Let me finish this first-

<p class="centered">She looks down and notices she has already finished.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Oh, actually, I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

<p class="centered">She goes upstairs to her room and sees Izumi sleeping. She gets mad and almost punches him in the face, but stops at the last second. She climbs past him, into bed. She tries putting on the blanket and realizes he is sleeping on it. Furiously, she pulls it with a lot of force, sending Izumi rolling and crashing into the floor off the bed. She gets comfortable under the blanket and goes to sleep.</p>

<p class="centered">After a few minutes pass, Izumi gets up and notices that he's lying on the floor.</p>

**Izumi:** Ow, I really did fall, huh, I thought it was a dream.

<p class="centered">He stands up</p>

**Izumi:** I wonder how that happened?

<p class="centered">She looks at Hitsumi sleeping peacefully</p>

**Izumi:** I guess she's not waking up.

<p class="centered">He goes down and takes a seat</p>

**Reina:** Oh, Izumi, I was just about to wake you up.

**Izumi:** *yawns* I fell off the bed and woke up.

**Reina:** Oh my, how did that happen?

**Izumi:** I don’t know.

**Reina:** Are you hurt?

**Izumi:** No, no, I'm good. *stretches*

**Reina:** Good, what would you like for dinner?

**Izumi:** Uh, I don’t wanna think right now. Just get me whatever I had yesterday. Hopefully, today there won’t be a side of flying beer bottles.

<p class="centered">Reina gets surprised and chuckles.</p>

**Izumi:** What's so funny?

**Reina:** Nothing, Hitsumi said the same thing.

**Izumi:** Huh, Oh, yeah, whatever, can you just bring me the food? I just wanna go back to bed.

**Reina:** Yes yes, of course.

<p class="centered">After some time passes, she brings the food for a half-asleep Izumi</p>

**Reina:** Here you go.

<p class="centered">Izumi goes to take the burger, but completely misses.</p>

**Reina:** Uh, Izumi, do you need some help?

**Izumi:** Whatt? Nah, I'm good.

<p class="centered">He waves his hand to signal that he doesn’t need help. He keeps his hand down on the table, but he places it on a fork, sending it flying. It misses a customer and gets stuck on the wall.</p>

**Customer:** HEY, ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?

<p class="centered">He walks up to him and grabs him by the collar.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi keeps his hands up.</p>

**Izumi:** *smiles* Chill man, it didn’t hit you right.

**Reina:** Sir, please let him go. I apologize on his behalf.

**Customer:** Ms. Asuka, why are you apologizing for this guy?

**Izumi:** Ms. Asuka, huh. It seems you have got quite a loyal fan base.

**Reina:** Be quiet.

<p class="centered">The customer lets him down.</p>

**Customer:** I'm only leaving you for her sake, don’t let me catch you doing the same shit again.

<p class="centered">He walks back to his seat, and Izumi sits down.</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs* That was a close one, huh?

<p class="centered">Reina silently pulls a chair and sits next to him.</p>

**Izumi:** Oi Reina, are you sure you should be taking a break right now?

<p class="centered">She picks up the burger and brings it to his mouth.</p>

**Izumi:** What? (surprised)

**Reina:** You are in no shape to eat on your own, Izumi.

**Izumi:** So?

<p class="centered">She looks down bashfully.</p>

**Reina:** So open your mouth.

**Izumi:** WHAT?

**Reina:** DON’T MAKE IT HARDER THAN IT NEEDS TO BE.

<p class="centered">Izumi sighs and opens his mouth while looking away. After a few bites, he starts coughing. He looks up and notices her holding a glass of water.</p>

**Reina:** Drink.

<p class="centered">He silently agrees and takes a sip. Some time passes, and he finishes</p>

**Izumi:** Ahh, I'm soo full.

<p class="centered">He stands up and turns to walk back to his bed</p>

**Izumi:** Good night, Reina-

<p class="centered">She grabs him by his arm</p>

**Reina:** Wait.

<p class="centered">He turns around, confused.</p>

**Izumi:** What?-

<p class="centered">She reaches for his face</p>

**Izumi:** Woah woah woah.

<p class="centered">She wipes off some food from his cheek and licks it.</p>

**Reina:** Doesn’t taste too bad.

<p class="centered">She comes to the realization of what she just did, and they stare at each other. The crowd watching them erupts, and they start clapping and cheering them on.</p>

**Customer 1:** WAY TO GO, REINA.

**Customer 2:** SOO CUTEE.

<p class="centered">Izumi turns around nervously.</p>

**Izumi:** You know, I should probably head to bed.

<p class="centered">Reina also turns around nervously.</p>

**Reina:** Yeah, you're probably right. I also need to continue my work.

<p class="centered">She walks away and starts taking orders. Izumi walks upstairs, enters his room and closes the door</p>

**Izumi:** *(What was that!)* I really need to sleep, man.

<p class="centered">He falls face-first onto the pillow. He turns his head and tries pulling on the blanket. Hitsumi doesn’t let go and snuggles onto the blanket even harder. Izumi sighs and lets her have the blanket and goes to sleep.</p>

<p class="centered">- The next day-</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi raises his hands in the air and sits up</p>

**Izumi:** *yawns*

<p class="centered">He looks around and notices that Hitsumi is missing. He looks at the clock and notices the time is 8</p>

**Izumi:** Oh damn, I'm kinda late. But this is still way too early for her to have woken up.

<p class="centered">He stands up, yawns and scratches his chest and realizes he took off his t-shirt before sleeping.</p>

**Izumi:** It has to be on the floor somewhere.

<p class="centered">He looks around for some time and gives up.</p>

**Izumi:** It's pretty early anyway; not like there are going to be many customers. I’ll search for it later.

<p class="centered">He goes down and sees Reina cleaning the place</p>

**Reina:** Oh, Good morning, Izumi-

<p class="centered">She turns around and covers her mouth when she realizes he's shirtless.</p>

**Izumi:** Good morning. You saw Hitsumi.

<p class="centered">She blushes and covers her eyes, but leaves enough space between her fingers to peek.</p>

**Reina:** Uhh, umm, I think she is in the backyard.

**Izumi:** Oh, okay, thanksss.

<p class="centered">He turns and starts walking down the hallway towards the backyard, but Reina remembers something Hitsumi said.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Also, if Izumi asks. Don’t tell him I'm here.

<p class="centered">She immediately calls out to him.</p>

**Reina:** IZUMI, WAIT.

<p class="centered">She runs in front of him and pushes him back. He looks at her, confused. She looks up and realizes she has her hands on his chest. She starts moving them around.</p>

**Izumi:** *smirks* Um, Reina, if you wanted to feel me up, you could’ve just asked.

<p class="centered">She looks up at him and instantly pulls back.</p>

**Reina:** Uhh, Ehhh, I'm sorry, it's just that, she isn’t actually there. Yeah. I remember her going outside for a walk. That’s it. Yeah.

<p class="centered">He looks at her doubtfully.</p>

**Izumi:** Uh-huh. I think I'll check anyway, maybe you saw someone else.

<p class="centered">He walks past her, and she starts to panic.</p>

**Reina:** *(Think think think)*

<p class="centered">She suddenly screams out loud. Hitsumi hears her scream from the backyard and turns towards the door. Izumi turns around and looks at Reina</p>

**Izumi:** Are you okay?

<p class="centered">Reina sits crouched down on the floor</p>

**Izumi:** Are you okay?

<p class="centered">He kneels next to her.</p>

**Reina:** I hit my foot against the post.

<p class="centered">She grabs her foot, and he inspects it.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh, you broke your nail.

**Reina:** *cries* It hurtsss.

**Izumi:** Alright, alright, wait.

<p class="centered">He picks her up and carries her to the counter</p>

**Reina:** *blushes* Yeah, put me down there.

<p class="centered">He places her on the counter.</p>

**Reina:** There should be a first aid kit under the counter somewhere.

<p class="centered">He looks around and finds it. He takes out a sanitizer and some cotton to clean the wound. As he goes to clean it, he hears a noise from the backyard, akin to wood falling. He instantly turns his attention to the backyard and moves towards it.</p>

**Izumi:** Reina, just hang on for a moment, please.

<p class="centered">As he moves away, Reina lets out another scream.</p>

**Reina:** Ahh, it hurts soo much.

<p class="centered">He turns around out of worry for Reina and contemplates what to do.</p>

**Izumi:** *(This situation is way too suspicious. What should I do.)*

<p class="centered">As he decides to help Reina first, one of the chefs walks out of the kitchen.</p>

**Chef:** Oh, Reina, what's going on?

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles.</p>

**Izumi:** *(Perfect)* Hey, she broke her nail. I have the cotton on the table. Dip it in the sanitizer and clean her wound. I’ll be right back.

**Chef:** Yes, sir. *salutes* Leave it to me.

<p class="centered">He jumps over a table in the way and makes his way to the backyard.</p>

**Reina:** NOO, IZUMIII.

<p class="centered">As he goes to open the back door, Hitsumi opens the door and enters</p>

**Hitsumi:** Oh, good morning.

<p class="centered">He walks past her and checks the backyard. He notices nothing out of the ordinary</p>

**Hitsumi:** Helloo?

<p class="centered">He turns around and looks at her</p>

**Izumi:** Good morning.

**Hitsumi:** Something wrong?

<p class="centered">He walks past her</p>

**Izumi:** Nope, nothing at all.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* So what do you wanna do today?

**Izumi:** I don’t know, we can just go around the town.

**Hitsumi:** You got nothing else to say?

<p class="centered">He stops walking and turns around.</p>

**Izumi:** What do you mean? (confused)

<p class="centered">She remembers what he said last night</p>

**Hitsumi:** Don’t you remember last night?

**Izumi:** No?

**Hitsumi:** *scoffs* Nothing.

<p class="centered">She catches up and walks past him</p>

**Izumi:** *(smiles)*

<p class="centered">Hitsumi walks past and sees Reina on the counter, struggling to help her, with the chef nearby.</p>

**Reina:** AHH, STOP IT.

**Chef:** Miss Reina, can you please not move so much?

**Hitsumi:** What is going on here?

<p class="centered">Izumi remembers and runs to Reina.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh, sorry, sorry, my bad. (smiling playfully)

<p class="centered">She looks at him and puffs her cheeks</p>

**Izumi:** Yo, let me take over.

**Chef:** Yes, sir.

<p class="centered">He walks back into the kitchen.</p>

**Izumi:** Don’t worry, it will be over soon.

<p class="centered">He slowly disinfects her wound.</p>

**Reina:** Ow ow ow.

<p class="centered">She grabs onto his left hand. Izumi smiles and holds her hand firmly. After some time passes, he finishes it and ties some cotton around the wound using a gauze.</p>

**Izumi:** There, finished.

<p class="centered">She moves her foot around.</p>

**Reina:** Thanks, it feels much better now.

**Hitsumi:** Now, can we all stop overreacting?

**Reina:** Hey, it hurts, okay.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs*

**Izumi:** *giggles*

<p class="centered">Hitsumi smiles but realizes someone is watching them. She turns towards the entrance and notices some thugs similar to the ones she saw earlier that Izumi fought outside. She turns towards Izumi to warn him.</p>

**Hitsumi:** IZUMI LOOK OUT.

<p class="centered">Izumi had already noticed them but was surprised that Hitsumi also felt their presence. Before he could contemplate how she was able to do it, one of the thugs threw a knife at Reina. He reaches forward and blocks the knife with his hand. The knife impales his right palm in a similar way the spear did, and goes through. Blood starts flowing rapidly onto the floorboards</p>

**Izumi:** Aww, and that hand just healed as well.

**Reina:** IZUMI, ARE YOU OKAY?

**Izumi:** (unfazed) Yeah, I'm fine.

<p class="centered">He pulls out the knife and drops it on the floor. He takes the gauze and wraps some around his wound.</p>

**Izumi:** Alright, you’ve already injured me. When are you planning on showing yourselves?

<p class="centered">A group of thugs walk into the restaurant with a grin on their faces.</p>

**Izumi:** A bunch of you guys already lost to me once. What makes you think you can win now?

**Thug 1:** Because now you’re not our target.

<p class="centered">Few of them look towards Reina and Hitsumi. They throw two knives at them.</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs* That's not gonna work twice.

<p class="centered">He grabs the knife, coming towards Reina by the handle. But, before he could grab the knife thrown toward Hitsumi, he notices her eye tracking the knife and gets surprised again. He realizes it's not gonna hit any vitals and decides not to stop it. She manages to not only track but also dodge the knife, but it still cuts her forearm.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi’s eyes widen</p>

**Izumi:** *(Just what was she doing back there?)*

**Hitsumi:** *screams lightly*.

<p class="centered">She holds her arm to stop the bleeding and sits down</p>

<p class="centered">Her scream brings him back to reality</p>

**Hitsumi:** WHAT THE FUCK.

**Izumi:** *sticks his tongue out* My bad.

<p class="centered">The thugs smile and get ready to throw another set of knives.</p>

**Thug:** He isn’t even that fast; the last group was probably just weak. Get him boys.

<p class="centered">They charge their arms, but before they can throw them, Izumi looks at them and activates his sakai</p>

**Izumi:** (Looking at them furiously) Did you think I'm just gonna let you get away with that?

<p class="centered">He walks towards them.</p>

**Izumi:** Sure, that was kinda my fault, but you still threw a knife at my friend.

**Thug:** Eek.

<p class="centered">They try to move back but are stuck in their position. As he raises his hand towards the thug in front, he closes his eyes and tries to look away.</p>

**Izumi:** *grins*.

<p class="centered">As he gets close, suddenly there's a sound outside. The thug turns around, and Izumi looks past him, outside. The thugs in the back are sent flying around. A hand reaches out of the blinding sunlight and pulls the thug in front of Izumi out of the store. The thugs scream in fear as the sound of beatings increases. He walks out and sees Raiga beating up all the thugs.</p>

**Raiga:** YOU HAD ENOUGH YET? (As he grabs a guy from the floor by the collar)

<p class="centered">As Izumi looks confused, Sora comes behind him and puts his arms around his shoulders.</p>

**Sora:** Good morning, Izumi. How’s your day so far? *grins*

<p class="centered">He looks at him uninterested</p>

**Izumi:** What do you want?

<p class="centered">As Raiga puts down the thug, he tells them to scram. All the thugs get up and run away</p>

**Raiga:** Is that good enough, Captain? *smiles*

<p class="centered">He takes his hand off his shoulders, and Izumi repulses back</p>

**Sora:** (smiles and nods) More than enough, Raiga.

<p class="centered">He walks forward and turns back toward Izumi</p>

**Sora:** Don’t you think you owe us one now, Izumi?

**Izumi:** I had everything under control.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi walks out holding her forearm to stop the blood flow.</p>

<p class="centered">Sora looks past him and notices the cut on her arm.</p>

**Sora:** You sure about that?

<p class="centered">He turns around and notices the wound.</p>

**Izumi:** That was planned.

**Hitsumi:** YOU PLANNED FOR ME TO GET MY ARM CUT!

**Izumi:** *smiles* I’ll explain later.

**Hitsumi:** YOU…

<p class="centered">He turns back toward Sora</p>

**Izumi:** So, tell me, what do you want?

**Sora:** Fine, I'll get to the point. I want you to join the Gokurengumi. We can use someone as strong as you.

<p class="centered">He reaches out his hand for a handshake.</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs and turns around* Same old song, I'm not interested.

<p class="centered">He closes his hand and takes it back.</p>

**Sora:** Those guys are gonna come back, you know.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks over his shoulder at Sora.</p>

**Sora:** The moment you beat them in the building, you became their target. And they won't stop until you’re dead.

<p class="centered">He walks towards Izumi</p>

**Sora:** They aren’t smart enough to realize they can't beat you. All they know is that you’re not with us, and therefore don’t have our security. And as long as don’t, they’ll keep coming after you.

<p class="centered">He looks back at Hitsumi.</p>

**Sora:** And you're friends. And who knows.

<p class="centered">He smiles cunningly</p>

**Sora:** And hypothetically speaking of course, if we were to help them, Well, I doubt even you would be able to protect her. But, if we were on your side, rather you on ours, I could guarantee your safety.

<p class="centered">He reaches out his hand again with a smile.</p>

**Izumi:** What? (with a serious look).

<p class="centered">He turns around and looks at him face to face.</p>

**Izumi:** Are you threatening me?

**Sora:** *smiles* I wonder.

<p class="centered">Izumi closes his eyes and looks down.</p>

<p class="centered">-In his mind-</p>

<p class="centered">He stands before the same dark silhouette of himself and looks at it as if he is questioning it.</p>

**Izumi:** This is what you want too isn’t it.

<p class="centered">The dark silhouette of him smiles. He sighs. He turns and looks at Hitsumi standing behind him. She looks at him, hoping for him to choose what she wants.</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs*.

<p class="centered">He looks back up at Sora and smiles.</p>

**Izumi:** Fine, I'll entertain you.

<p class="centered">He shakes his hand as they grin at each other</p>

**Sora:** Well, then. Welcome to the team, Kurosaki Izumi.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi screams from the back</p>

**Hitsumi:** ME TOO.

**Izumi:** Please take care of us, Captain.

<p class="centered">-----------------------------------------------</p>









<p class="centered">In a poorly lit room a man sits on a throne wearing a robe and another man stands next to him. A demon appears and kneels before him.</p>

**Demon:** Sir, the demon responsible for Sector-G has fallen.

**Man on the throne:** *scoffs* why is he messing with the Gokurengumi, he was supposed to stay low, The one in charge of the G-division is pretty strong. This is the second time.

**Demon:** That’s the thing sir. This time it wasn’t the Gokurengumi who slew him.

**Man on the throne:** What? *he looks at him confused*.

**Demon:** Yes Sir, the one responsible for his death didn’t crush his heart, so he sent a message before his end.

<p class="centered">The man looks at him with wide eyes and full attention</p>

**Demon:** Shuraaa.

<p class="centered">The man lies back on his throne and starts laughing. He stands up and walks over to a table.</p>

**Man on the throne:** Finally, you show yourself again, Kurosaki. *grins* We’re so close. After we get rid of him we will have no one to oppose us.

<p class="centered">He stabs a wanted poster on the table with a knife. Its a bounty poster with a picture of Izumi under the name Shura. The man turns towards the other one.</p>

**Man on the throne:** Ikki, dispose of the rest of the demon in charge of the other sectors.

<p class="centered">The demon looks up at him concerned</p>

**Demon:** But Sir, why?

**Man on the throne:** Are you questioning my decision?

<p class="centered">The demon looks back down with a shiver running down his spine.</p>

**Demon:** NO SIR, its just that some of them are my friends, so I thought…

<p class="centered">The man laughs.</p>

**Man:** How about this then? If you kill me right here, you’re friends will live.

<p class="centered">He turns towards Ikki</p>

**Man:** If this demon kills me, let the other live and serve him till your last breath.

**Ikki:** Understood sir.

**Man:** There you go, now come, try and kill me and save your friends.

<p class="centered">The demon sits there frozen in fear.</p>

**Man:** What? Aren't you gonna save your friends?

<p class="centered">The demon remains speechless.</p>

**Man:** *sighs* Fine, I guess you leave me no choice, I’ll explain it to you. They will attract unnecessary attention, besides their job is already done. There are so many of you anyways, there’s no point in trying to get them back either.

<p class="centered">The demon stays kneeling in silence.</p>

**Man:** But, out of respect for your love for your friends, I’ll do you a favor.

<p class="centered">He looks up hopefully with a smile.</p>

**Demon:** REALLY SIR.

**Man:** *smiles* Of course, after all you’ve delivered with such a good news.

**Demon:** Thank you very much, Sir. What is the favor.

**Man:** *grins with malice*.

<p class="centered">He turns towards Ikki</p>

**Man:** Kill him first then kill the rest, *he looks over his shoulder at the demon* that way he wont have to live knowing his friends are dead, and that he would have changed the outcome by killing me.

<p class="centered">The demon falls on his back</p>

**Demon:** IM SORRY SIR PLEASE FORRGIVE ME.

<p class="centered">The mans expression turns cold.</p>

**Man:** Just be quiet and die, I don’t like noise unless its praising me.

<p class="centered">He turns his back towards the demon and walks out of the room</p>

<p class="centered">Ikki walks towards the demon in silence</p>

**Demon:** NO, PLEASE, SPARE ME.

<p class="centered">He continues walking towards him and materializes his sword.</p>

**Demon:** NO, NOOOOOO.

<p class="centered">His screams flood the room, but they’re brought to a rest as Ikki beheads him.</p>
