
<p class="centered">After an hour</p>

**Hitsumi:** WHY IS THIS PLACE SO BIG?

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles</p>

**Hitsumi:** AND WHY IS EVERY PLACE FILLED?

**Izumi:** Chill, we’ll find a place.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs*

<p class="centered">She notices a restaurant at the corner of the road</p>

**Hitsumi:** What about there?

**Izumi:** Sure.

<p class="centered">They head inside the place and see the entire place filled except for one table at the end.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Finally, somewhere to sit.

<p class="centered">They take a seat and wait for 5 minutes</p>

**Hitsumi:** When is the waiter gonna give us the menu?

<p class="centered">Izumi looks over and sees all the servers barely managing to keep up with the orders.</p>

**Izumi:** I think it’s gonna be some time if we wait for them. I’ll go get it.

<p class="centered">He walks over behind a waitress taking an order from a table</p>

**Waitress:** Sure, got it. I’ll bring it out as soon as possible.

<p class="centered">She turns around hurriedly and bumps into Izumi</p>

**Izumi:** Whoa there, take a breather.

**Waitress:** Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn’t see you.

**Izumi:** No problem. Hey, can I get a menu perchance? We’ve been waiting for 5 minutes, and no one has given us one yet.

**Waitress:** I apologize, we’re just very busy today. Since the squad just came back everyone is celebrating. And as you can see, we are severely understaffed.

**Izumi:** Sure, no problem. We’re at that table in the corner.

**Waitress:** Yes, sir, I’ll bring you a menu right away.

**Izumi:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">He heads back and takes a seat</p>

**Hitsumi:** So, what did she say?

**Izumi:** The waitress? She said they’re understaffed and will bring a menu soon.

**Hitsumi:** Mmm.

<p class="centered">A few minutes pass</p>

**Waitress:** I'm sorry for the wait, here’s your menu.

**Izumi:** It’s fine. We understand.

**Waitress:** Thank you. Let me know when you’re ready to order.

<p class="centered">The waitress leaves</p>

**Izumi:** Here, you look at it first.

**Hitsumi:** Why? I'm probably not gonna know what half the things are.

<p class="centered">She looks at the menu</p>

**Hitsumi:** Oh, you guys have normal food.

**Izumi:** Well, yeah. We are also essentially humans, so we evolved the same, more or less.

**Hitsumi:** Okay, let’s see what we have here.

<p class="centered">She takes a look at the menu</p>

**Hitsumi:** Ahhh, why are there so many items?

**Izumi:** Cooking is pretty easy here, if you know how to use your angelic powers that is.

**Hitsumi:** Angelic powers?

**Izumi:** Yes, they are quite useful. You can use them to do a lot of stuff.

**Hitsumi:** What is your level of purity?

**Izumi:** Oh, uhhh.

**Hitsumi:** Yes.

**Izumi:** Well, it is-

**Waitress:** Are you ready to order? (as she sneaks up behind him)

**Izumi:** *startled* Oh my. You scared the shit out of me.

**Waitress:** Oh, I'm sorry.

**Izumi:** It's fine. Yeah, we are ready to order, right? (looks at Hitsumi).

**Hitsumi:** Oh, yeah. I’ll have a regular burger meal.

**Izumi:** I’ll have the same.

**Waitress:** Good choice, sir. I’ll bring it right away. *smiles*

**Izumi:** *smiles back*

<p class="centered">She walks away</p>

**Hitsumi:** *staring at him* What was that?

**Izumi:** What do you mean?

**Hitsumi:** Why did she say “good choice” only to you? It wasn’t even your choice, you just copied me.

**Izumi:** *laughs* Chill, it’s not that deep.

**Hitsumi:** *glares* *sighs* fine, I’ll let you off this time.

<p class="centered">After 20 minutes</p>

**Hitsumi:** WHY IS IT TAKING SOOO LONG?

**Izumi:** I don’t know, they seem pretty busy.

**Hitsumi:** I understand, but I'm also hungry.

<p class="centered">She calls out for the waitress.</p>

**Waitress:** Yes, ma'am.

**Hitsumi:** How much longer will it take? No pressure.

**Waitress:** Please forgive us, we are severely understaffed right now, so we are kind of struggling.

**Hitsumi:** Oh. Why?

**Waitress:** Our owner, my brother just died. So, we had to spend a lot of money on his funeral. So, we couldn’t pay our staff and had to let most of them go.

**Hitsumi:** Damn, I'm sorry.

**Waitress:** No, I'm sorry. You’re a customer, this is not your problem. I’ll bring your food.

<p class="centered">She comes back soon after</p>

**Waitress:** Here’s your order, ma'am.

<p class="centered">She turns around swiftly and tries to walk away</p>

**Izumi:** Five.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi looks at him confused.</p>

**Waitress:** Sir?

**Izumi:** That’s how many times you apologized to us in the few minutes we talked

**Waitress:** Oh.

<p class="centered">She looks down, embarrassed.</p>

<p class="centered">He hands her the thief’s purse.</p>

**Waitress:** Sir, this is much more than your bill.

**Izumi:** Think of it as a tip.

<p class="centered">She reaches out to grab it, but holds herself back</p>

**Waitress:** No, I can't accept this.

<p class="centered">He takes her hand and places it in his</p>

**Izumi:** Don’t give me that. Just take it.

**Waitress:** Oh *tears up* Thank you, sir.

**Izumi:** Kurosaki, Kurosaki Izumi.

**Reina:** *wipes her eyes and smiles* Asuka, Asuka Reina.

**Izumi:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">Reina walks away with a smile on her face. Izumi turns back and looks at Hitsumi, and the smile on his face vanishes</p>

**Izumi:** Ok, wait, I know how this looks-

<p class="centered">Some time passes as they eat in silence</p>

**Hitsumi:** The food is really good, no.

**Izumi:** Yeah, it’s pretty good. (He says as he rubs the bump on his head)

**Hitsumi:** Come on, I’m sure it doesn’t hurt that much after having your hand stabbed by a spear.

**Izumi:** Physically maybe not, but it’s the mental damage, ok.

**Hitsumi:** *laughs*

**Izumi:** *sighs*

<p class="centered">As they are enjoying their meal, a police officer breaks down the front door. As he storms towards the counter in anger.</p>

**Officer 1:** Where’s Reina?

**Reina:** I’m here, I’m here.

<p class="centered">She yells from behind the counter</p>

**Officer 1:** How long do we have to wait for the money?

**Hitsumi:** Who is that guy?

**Izumi:** He is a Keitaigumi officer, like police, I guess

**Hitsumi:** Why are the names so confusing?

**Izumi:** I didn’t come up with them, ok?

<p class="centered">She looks back at them.</p>

**Reina:** The money is coming; we have just been really tight for cash recently.

<p class="centered">Another officer comes from behind him and slams the desk</p>

**Officer 2:** This is the fourth week in a row, Reina.

**Reina:** I genuinely apologize, Mr. Michiro.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi looks at Izumi</p>

**Hitsumi:** Aren’t you gonna do anything?

**Izumi:** I just ate, man. Let me rest.

**Hitsumi:** Seriously, you were flirting with her not too long ago.

<p class="centered">Michiro picks up a beer bottle from the countertop</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs*

<p class="centered">Out of nowhere, a bottle gets thrown at his head</p>

**Hitsumi:** OH MY, ARE YOU OKAY?

**Reina:** IZUMI.

**Michiro:** LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU.

<p class="centered">She turns back towards him, scared.</p>

**Izumi:** Owwww (sarcastically).

**Hitsumi:** Now, do you have a reason to fight?

**Izumi:** Maybe.

<p class="centered">Michiro looks at her and grabs her by her collar</p>

**Michiro:** Listen here you bitch, you’re gonna pay us today.

<p class="centered">He looks at her with lustful eyes</p>

**Michiro:** One way or the other *smirks*.

**Reina:** LET ME GO!

**Officer 1:** Shut up *smiles*.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi looks at Izumi</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs*

<p class="centered">As he is about to get up, another guy wearing a hood with hair covering his face walks into the store and puts his hands on the officer's shoulder</p>

**Officer 1:** Huh, who are you?

<p class="centered">He turns around and looks at his face</p>

**???:** Come on now, no need to get rowdy.

<p class="centered">His eyes widen as he recognizes who he is from his eyes and a little bit of his face</p>

**Officer 1:** You... (angrily)

**Michiro:** No need to get angry, officer. This man is no threat. What do you want?

<p class="centered">He asks as he turns towards him</p>

**???:** Put the girl down, and we can all go our merry way.

**Michiro:** Oh? And what if I don’t?

**???:** *smiles* Then I’ll have to make you.

**Michiro:** BOYS.

<p class="centered">5 more police officers storm into the building</p>

**Michiro:** Don’t get cocky just because you’re some B-rate raider.

**???:** B-rate? That’s just rude.

<p class="centered">The officers surround him.</p>

**Michiro:** There are 7 of us. There’s nothing you can do. Without harming civilians, that is.

**???:** *frowns*

<p class="centered">He looks around and sees everyone looking at him with fear in their eyes, not knowing if they’re gonna get hurt, and mothers covering their children</p>

**Michiro:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">His smile begins to fade as the man starts smiling</p>

**???:** Wanna bet?

<p class="centered">Michiro scoffs</p>

**Michiro:** KEITAIGUMI, ATTACK!

**Izumi:** Ooo, this is gonna be interesting.

<p class="centered">4 of them rush and jump at him with their swords</p>

**???:** *smirks*

<p class="centered">As they all thrust towards him, they notice he is missing. They look around and don’t see him. He appears above them and lands down kicking one of them on the head, sending him face-first into the ground. Another officer comes from behind him. He moves to the left and dodges the sword, then he turns left and grabs the officer's hand with his right hand, lifts him, and throws him to the ground.</p>

**???:** Don’t pick up what you can't use.

<p class="centered">The other three officers rush towards him</p>

**???:** *sighs*

<p class="centered">He keeps his hand on his katana and prepares to unsheathe it</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at his katana in shock</p>

**Izumi:** *(I wasn’t wrong. That katana, I could swear …)*

<p class="centered">As all the officers raise their katanas to strike at the same time, He unsheathes his blade and in one cut, he parries all of them. In parrying them, he also ended up cutting all their swords in two by mistake.</p>

**Izumi:** *(That blade)*

<p class="centered">Hitsumi notices the serious look on Izumi’s face</p>

**???:** My bad, didn’t know you guys were so weak.

<p class="centered">Michiro starts to back up. Officer 1 starts panicking, then he has an idea and smiles. As the man approaches Michiro, he hears the officer shout from behind</p>

**Officer 1:** Oi piece of shit.

<p class="centered">He turns around in disappointment</p>

**???:** Name-calling? That's low even for you.

<p class="centered">The officer holds up a gun toward him</p>

**Hitsumi:** You guys have guns? (surprised)

**Izumi:** (takes a sip of his drink) Sure, we do.

**Hitsumi:** You’re enjoying this way too much.

**Izumi:** *smiles*

**???:** Whoa whoa whoa. What are you planning on doing with that? Could you hurt someone? (sarcastically)

**Officer 1:** *smiles* I’m not foolish enough to try to shoot you.

<p class="centered">His smile widens as he shifts his aim to an older woman guarding a child</p>

**???:** NOO.

<p class="centered">He steps towards him, but before he can get to him, the officer shoots. He instantly changes direction and gets in between the bullet and the grandma. Just before the bullet strikes, he barely manages to deflect it, causing it to ricochet into a wall. He then looks at the officer with rage in his eyes and unleashes his Sakai</p>

**Izumi:** *whistles* (impressed by his Sakai)

<p class="centered">The officer starts walking back towards the exit. He strengthens his Sakai as he slowly walks towards him. He trips and falls on the floor in fear, and quickly manages to crawl out of the restaurant and make a run for his life. He turns his attention towards Michiro, who is paralyzed on the ground in fear. He walks towards him and grabs him by his shirt</p>

**Michiro:** *gulps*

<p class="centered">Michiro looks at him in terror, not able to make words</p>

**???:** This is your last chance. Run. And don’t let me find you again.

<p class="centered">He lets him down, and Michiro runs like he has never run before as he struggles to make his way out of the restaurant</p>

**Michiro:** YOU’LL REGRET THIS (with a voice crack and stutter).

<p class="centered">Reina walks towards him.</p>

**Reina:** Um, excuse me. Is your hand okay?

<p class="centered">He loosens his face and turns around. He looks at his hand and notices he's bleeding</p>

**???:** Oh, this had to have been when…

<p class="centered">He thinks back to the bullet and realizes that he was too slow to block with the blade. He ended up having to block with the handle of his sword, and the bullet ended up hitting his hand a bit</p>

**???:** Don’t worry about it, I'm fine. What about you?

**Reina:** *nods her head* Mmm, I'm fi- wait, aren’t you…

<p class="centered">She thinks for some time and opens her mouth in shock</p>

<p class="centered">Hitsumi looks around and notices his face</p>

**Hitsumi:** AKIHIKO!

<p class="centered">Sora gets pissed</p>

**Sora:** IT’S AKIHITO

**Reina:** You’re Akihito Sora.

<p class="centered">All the people start mumbling</p>

**Person 1:** Wait, is that Akihito?

**Person 2:** It totally is, isn’t it?

**Person 3:** THANK YOU, AKIHITO.

**Person 4:** YOU’RE THE BEST.

<p class="centered">All the people started to form a huge crowd around him</p>

**Sora:** Oh, this is gonna be a problem.

<p class="centered">Out of nowhere, he disappears into thin air. All the people start exclaiming.</p>

**Person 1:** What was that?

**Person 2:** He just disappeared.

**Person 3:** No, I wanted an autograph.

**Person 4:** That was soo cool!

<p class="centered">Hitsumi Looks towards Izumi</p>

**Hitsumi:** How did he do that?

**Izumi:** It’s called a silent flash. Similar to how I stand in the air by interacting with the environment on a molecular level, you can also make it so that you don’t interact with any molecules, essentially making you silent.

**Hitsumi:** So, he moved without disturbing anything.

**Izumi:** Yes.

**Hitsumi:** That’s kinda cool, can u do that?

**Izumi:** It’s hard and requires a lot of practice compared to standing in the air,

**Hitsumi:** So, you can’t?

**Izumi:** Nope, I can, it’s pretty easy for me.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs*

**Izumi:** *laughs*

<p class="centered">Reina walks up to Izumi.</p>

**Reina:** How is your head?

<p class="centered">Izumi turns toward her.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh, I'm fine, don’t worry.

<p class="centered">As he says that, blood starts pouring from his head.</p>

**Reina:** Oh my God.

<p class="centered">She inspects his head and ties a bandage around it.</p>

**Reina:** There, that should help you a bit.

**Izumi:** *smiles* Thank you.

<p class="centered">As they look at each other, Hitsumi clears her throat</p>

**Hitsumi:** Actually, we were just leaving.

<p class="centered">Reina snaps back to reality.</p>

**Reina:** Oh yes, of course.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks towards Hitsumi, annoyed. She grabs him by his ear and drags him out</p>

**Izumi:** Ow ow ow.

**Hitsumi:** Shut up.

<p class="centered">Reina looks down, disappointed. Izumi looks towards Reina as he gets dragged out.</p>

**Izumi:** Byeee.

**Reina:** Bye.

<p class="centered">Reina: *(Come on, Reina, pull yourself together)*</p>

<p class="centered">Both of them exit the building</p>

**Izumi:** What was all that about?

**Hitsumi:** Hmph.

**Izumi:** *laughs*

**Hitsumi:** So what now?

**Izumi:** I don’t know, we need to find a place to stay.

<p class="centered">As they are talking, a man appears behind Izumi</p>

**???:** Are you alright?

<p class="centered">Izumi jumps and hides behind Hitsumi.</p>

**Izumi:** WTF. Who are you?

**Hitsumi:** Hey, let go of me.

<p class="centered">The man laughs</p>

**Izumi:** Hold on, you are…

<p class="centered">Hitsumi looks at him and recognizes him</p>

**Hitsumi:** AKIHIKO!

**Sora:** ITS AKIHITO.

<p class="centered">He glares at Hitsumi.</p>

**Izumi:** *laughs*.

**Sora:** So, how's your head?

**Izumi:** It’s fine.

<p class="centered">He looks at his bandaged-up head.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh, trust me, it's completely alright.

**Sora:** *smiles* That’s good.

<p class="centered">Walks up in front of him</p>

**Sora:** *grins* After all, it would be a shame if you got hurt after that stunt you pulled.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at him with a mixture of surprise and confusion.</p>

**Izumi:** *smiles* Whatever do you mean?

**Sora:** Come on, there’s no acting audition going on.

**Izumi:** *smirks*.

**Sora:** You got hit by the bottle on purpose, didn’t you?

**Izumi:** Why would I ever do that?

**Sora:** Why? To protect her, of course.

**Izumi:** *grins*

<p class="centered">Hitsumi looks at them confused.</p>

**Sora:** Don’t look so lost. It’s simple. Had he dodged, you would’ve gotten hit.

<p class="centered">She thinks and realizes that he is right</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Yeah, had he moved over there, the bottle would’ve hit me)*

<p class="centered">They stand face to face, smiling arrogantly at each other; their egos clash.</p>

**Izumi:** You’re pretty good.

**Sora:** You’re not that bad yourself.

<p class="centered">They stare each other down, Sora with his hands folded and Izumi with his hands in his pockets. As they were facing each other, two girls appeared above the building, and one of them called out to Sora</p>

**??? 1:** Oi Sora, What's taking you so long?

<p class="centered">Both of them jump down.</p>

**Sora:** Shion, I told you to go back.

**Shion:** I could have, but I knew you were gonna come here to meet him.

<p class="centered">She smiles, and she turns towards Izumi. She starts going in circles around Izumi and inspecting him</p>

**Shion:** And I wanted to see him for myself.

<p class="centered">Izumi gets mildly uncomfortable with her staring at him</p>

**Shion:** So you are the one who piqued Soras' interest.

**Izumi:** I guess. (he says without emotion)

<p class="centered">She pops in front of his face</p>

**Shion:** You’re kinda cute.*smiles*

**Izumi:** *silent*

**Shion:** Not a talkative type huh.

**Izumi:** Not really, I just don’t like girls who are too…. Forward.

**Shion:** *smiles* Interesting.

<p class="centered">She reaches out her hand for a handshake</p>

**Shion:** The name’s Shion, Kagerou Shion.

**Izumi:** (uninterested) uh huh.

<p class="centered">As he ignores her attempt at a handshake, she takes her hand back, disappointed</p>

**Shion:** Not gonna say your name?

**Izumi:** Izumi.

**Shion:** Last name?

**Izumi:** Kurosaki.

**Shion:** *puffs her cheeks* You’re no fun.

<p class="centered">She looks over at Hitsumi.</p>

**Shion:** And who are you?

<p class="centered">She goes up to her face.</p>

**Shion:** What's your name?

**Hitsumi:** Miyamoto Hitsumi.

**Shion:** *smiles widely* You’re even cuter than him.

<p class="centered">She leaps towards her, and Hitsumi moves away, sending Shion flying</p>

**Hitsumi:** Sorry, I'm not gay.

**Shion:** Aww.

<p class="centered">Sora face palms and sighs.</p>

**Sora:** Shion, stop disturbing them.

**Shion:** Whattt?

**??? 2:** How is your finger coming along, Captain?

<p class="centered">The other girl says as she inspects his bandaged finger.</p>

**Sora:** It's fine. Thank you, Shizuka.

<p class="centered">She smiles overjoyed</p>

**Shizuka:** *blushes* I'm glad I could help.

<p class="centered">She looks at Izumi. She walks over to him and leans forward.</p>

**Shizuka:** Allow me to thank you, it's been a long time since I have seen Captain so happy.

**Sora:** SHIZUKA! (he says, embarrassed.)

**Izumi:** *laughs*

**Shizuka:** What? You smiled when you talked about him.

**Sora:** ….

<p class="centered">She turns back to Izumi.</p>

**Shizuka:** You're Kurosaki, right?

**Izumi:** Yeah.

<p class="centered">She extends her hand.</p>

**Shizuka:** My name’s Kazehana Shizuka.

<p class="centered">Izumi shakes her hand and smiles.</p>

**Izumi:** Kurosaki Izumi.

<p class="centered">Shion gets pissed</p>

**Shion:** Why did you shake her hand and not mine?

<p class="centered">Izumi ignores her</p>

**Shion:** DON’T IGNORE ME.

<p class="centered">Shizuka walks over to Hitsumi. Shizuka extends her arm. Hitsumi smiles and shakes her hand</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Wow, she smells so good.)*

<p class="centered">Sora turns around</p>

**Sora:** Shizuka, Shion, we’re leaving

**Shizuka:** Okay.

**Shion:** Why are we leaving so soonnnnn?

**Sora:** Shion. (he says sternly)

**Shion:** okayyy okayyy, Captain.

<p class="centered">She walks towards them and turns around.</p>

**Shion:** Byeeeee, Izumiii and Hitsumiii *smiles*.

**Izumi:** *ignores her*

**Shizuka:** See you around. *smiles*

**Izumi:** Byeee.

**Hitsumi:** Byeee.

<p class="centered">Shion gets annoyed and starts yelling. Sora grabs her and drags her back. Sora turns and looks at Izumi, and they smile at each other. He turns around again, and they walk away</p>

**Izumi:** They were kinda nice, no?

**Hitsumi:** Yeah.

**Izumi:** Except Shion.

**Hitsumi:** Yeah.

<p class="centered">They both laugh. As they were about to walk away to search for a place to stay, Reina walked out.</p>

**Reina:** Um, Izumi.

**Izumi:** Oh, Reina. What's up?

**Reina:** I overheard that you guys are looking for a place to stay.

**Izumi:** Yeah.

**Reina:** I have an empty room upstairs since my brother just died.

**Izumi:** Well, we don’t have money, though.

<p class="centered">She immediately responds hastily.</p>

**Reina:** That’s not a problem, after all, you’ve already given me so much money.

**Izumi:** But it's a personal room, right?

**Reina:** (looks down and thinks about it as she holds her hand) It is, but I need to move on. What's happened has happened.

**Izumi:** *smiles and comforts her* Thank you.

<p class="centered">She looks up at him</p>

<p class="centered">Hitsumi grabs him by his shirt and pulls him inside.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Okayyy, let's go inside.

**Izumi:** Oi, let me go.

<p class="centered">She continues to pull him inside.</p>

**Reina:** *laughs*

<p class="centered">She leads them to the room.</p>

**Reina:** Here it is.

<p class="centered">He looks around.</p>

**Izumi:** Yoo, this place looks sick.

<p class="centered">He sees a lot of pictures and models of cars</p>

**Izumi:** Was he a big car enthusiast?

**Hitsumi:** These cars are pretty similar to the ones on Earth.

**Izumi:** It is cause they are.

**Hitsumi:** How?

**Izumi:** We have a small view into what's going on on Earth.

**Hitsumi:** Ohh.

<p class="centered">Reina gets confused</p>

**Reina:** Have you never seen Earth?

<p class="centered">Hitsumi gulps, realizing her cover might get blown</p>

**Izumi:** Umm, she actually has short-term memory loss, so she often forgets small things, right?

<p class="centered">He turns towards Hitsumi.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *slightly annoyed* Yeah, you know me. Sometimes I can be a little dumb.

<p class="centered">(faking a smile as she says it)</p>

**Reina:** Oh, okay.

<p class="centered">Izumi sighs in relief. He walks over towards one of the car models, which is kept separate from the others.</p>

**Reina:** That one was his favorite.

**Izumi:** He has good taste. An RX-7 FD3S, huh.

**Reina:** That’s the car his favorite racer used to drive.

**Izumi:** Interesting.

**Reina:** He used to say that cars were the only good thing ever made by Earthlings.

**Izumi:** *laughs* right.

<p class="centered">He looks over at Hitsumi, glaring at her, and quiets down as she also fakes a little laugh.</p>

**Reina:** You seem to know a lot about cars.

**Izumi:** I know a little bit.

**Reina:** *smiles* You and my brother would’ve got along well.

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles</p>

**Reina:** He always played with them. He even wanted to race, but we were never rich enough to get him his own actual car.

<p class="centered">Izumi lifts a stand, holding a solid silver metal bracelet</p>

**Reina:** He always used to wear that.

**Izumi:** It looks really good.

**Reina:** You can keep it if you want.

**Izumi:** I couldn’t (surprised).

**Reina:** No, really, it's fine. He told us to sell it anyway, but I’d rather give it to you. You could consider it a thank you for the money.

**Izumi:** *smiles* Thank you.

<p class="centered">He wears it on his wrist.</p>

**Izumi:** It looks good, no.

**Reina:** Yes.

<p class="centered">He looks at Hitsumi</p>

**Izumi:** What do you think?

**Hitsumi:** *glares*

**Izumi:** *removes it and keeps it back on the stand* You know what, on second thought, I don’t want it.

**Reina:** Oh, ok.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi removes her shoes and falls onto the bed</p>

**Hitsumi:** Finally, I needed this so badly.

**Izumi:** Hey, wait, where will I sleep?

**Reina:** I'm sorry, there's only one bed.

**Hitsumi:** *laughs* unlucky.

**Reina:** I have a spare mattress in my room, but there's no place in this room. So you’ll have to sleep in my room.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi opens her eyes</p>

**Izumi:** Sur-

**Hitsumi:** He likes sleeping on the floor.

**Izumi:** What? (confused)

**Hitsumi:** You like sleeping on the floor, right?

<p class="centered">She says, and she looks at Izumi with a smile</p>

**Izumi:** *scared* YES, I LIKE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR.

**Reina:** Oh, okay.

**Izumi:** *smiles in fear*

**Reina:** Alright, good night.

**Izumi:** Good night.

**Hitsumi:** Good night.

<p class="centered">Reina closes the door and goes to sleep</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs*.

<p class="centered">He takes off his shirt and falls to the floor with his arms wide open.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *thinks* Fine, I feel bad for you. You can sleep on the bed.

**Izumi:** Really.

<p class="centered">He sits up happily</p>

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* I guess. Go to sleep before I regret it.

**Izumi:** Thank you.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi moves over to the side, and he gets on the bed. He tried to go to sleep but couldn’t</p>

<p class="centered">-After 10 minutes-</p>

**Izumi:** You asleep?

**Hitsumi:** No.

**Izumi:** *sighs* It’s been so long since I’ve gone to sleep in Dangai.

**Hitsumi:** How long?

**Izumi:** 5 years.

**Hitsumi:** Considering how long you’ve lived, it isn’t that long.

**Izumi:** I guess.

**Hitsumi:** Mmm.

**Izumi:** Mmm.

<p class="centered">After a few seconds of silence</p>

**Izumi:** I'm impressed that you were able to figure out that you should probably not make it obvious you’re from Earth.

**Hitsumi:** It just seemed right. But why should I not?

**Izumi:** The people of Dangai tend to look down upon Earthlings, as they like to call them.

**Hitsumi:** Why?

**Izumi:** Because of your lack of divinity.

**Hitsumi:** That’s bullshit.

**Izumi:** It is what it is.

**Hitsumi:** Mmm.

**Izumi:** Hey, why don't you want me to talk to Reina?

**Hitsumi:** It's not that I don’t want you to. I just don’t want you to flirt with a girl you barely know.

**Izumi:** You mean?

**Hitsumi:** Get to know her, then you can try to get with her.

**Izumi:** *sighs* Fair enough.

**Izumi:** *smiles and pats her head* Thank you for caring.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* Alright, now to go to sleep.

**Izumi:** *grins* I saw the way you looked at Sora.

**Hitsumi:** EXCUSE ME.

**Izumi:** *laughs* I'm joking, I'm joking.

**Hitsumi:** *puffs her face*.

**Izumi:** Alright, go to sleep.

**Hitsumi:** Good night.

**Izumi:** Good night.
