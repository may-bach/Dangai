# Chapter 4

**Hitsumi:** So, how do we start?

**Izumi:** Aoi, you ready?

**Aoi:** I’ve been ready for a long time now.

<p class="centered">The vines from the trees start growing out and take the form of a portal</p>

**Aoi:** You’re going to O-Ten, right?

**Izumi:** Yep.

**Hitsumi:** What’s that?

**Izumi:** It’s the capital of Dangai, right at the center.

**Hitsumi:** Why are we going there?

**Izumi:** To meet someone.

**Hitsumi:** And who is this someone?

**Izumi:** My best friend.

<p class="centered">The portal lights up, and you can see a huge city on the other side</p>

**Aoi:** Alright, you’re up.

**Izumi:** Come on, let’s go.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, is this safe, for a human, I mean?

**Izumi:** You’ll be fine, I think.

**Hitsumi:** You think—woahhh

<p class="centered">She screams as Izumi drags her through</p>

**Izumi:** Catch you later, bro.

**Aoi:** *smiles* bye

<p class="centered">The portal closes on Aoi’s side. They exit on the other side, but Izumi looks confused as they end up in what looks like the middle of the desert with no sun</p>

**Hitsumi:** Looks pretty barren for a capital.

**Izumi:** This is not O-Ten.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, where are we?

**Izumi:** I don’t know.

**Hitsumi:** Oh *her smile slowly turns into anger* YOU DON’T WHAT!!!!! I FOLLOW YOU TO THIS PLACE WHERE I DON’T KNOW, TRUSTING IN YOU AND-

**Izumi:** Wait a minute-

**Hitsumi:** YOU DON’T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE ARE.

**Izumi:** Hey, chill out

**Hitsumi:** HONESTLY, I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING-

**Izumi:** SHUT UP.

<p class="centered">Everything goes silent</p>

**Izumi:** Let me finish. *takes a breath* I know where we are.

**Hitsumi:** Oh, you should’ve said that.

**Izumi:** Well, technically.

**Hitsumi:** Technically? There’s nothing technical about it. You either do or you don’t.

**Izumi:** I know the place we’re in, but not exactly our location.

**Hitsumi:** Explain.

**Izumi:** We’re in what we call the nameless.

**Hitsumi:** What kind of name is that?

**Izumi:** A brilliant one, as it perfectly sums up what this place is.

**Hitsumi:** Which is?

**Izumi:** It’s a place where nothing exists.

**Hitsumi:** What do you mean?

**Izumi:** Dangai is a complicated place. While the center is where the capital is, there was no other place of note. O-Ten is a huge city with walls all around. It’s secluded from the outside world, as it does not need it. It’s completely self-sufficient. But that’s because there is no outside world. Dangai is essentially just O-Ten.

**Hitsumi:** So, it’s the capital because it’s the only city.

**Izumi:** There are other cities. Just not as big.

**Hitsumi:** So, villages.

**Izumi:** You could say that.

**Hitsumi:** So, why is this place “nameless”?

**Izumi:** I was getting there.

**Hitsumi:** Go on.

**Izumi:** *clears throat* As I was saying. Dangai can be split into 5 parts. The first in the center is O-Ten, surrounding which there is a huge ocean, kind of like a moat. Then there is a forest, which serves as a kind of barrier between O-Ten and the next part, the outskirts. It is the border of Dangai. It is made up of a lot of these small villages containing people of different races; it is the most populated place in Dangai.

**Hitsumi:** Why aren’t any of these places connected to Dangai?

<p class="centered">Izumi’s eyes go dark</p>

**Izumi:** *Racism.*

**Hitsumi:** Racism?

**Izumi:** Yes. When I say different races, I don’t mean black or white, but different species. Humans, some angels, elves, and Fey are primarily located in the capital. They are considered to be high-class. Whereas others like hybrids primarily and others like giants, lizardfolk, lycans, orcs, trolls, goblins, and even vampires are forced to live on the outskirts, completely disconnected from the capital. They are forced to fend for themselves in the wilderness, while the people in power look down on them and insult them. The only way they could ever make it to the capital was if they were either sold as slaves or recruited as soldiers, just to be put on the frontline and die meaningless deaths.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi’s eyes widen as Izumi forms a fist.</p>

**Izumi:** Even the police sent to protect them just extort them and take advantage of the fact that no one would ask. They were forced to live as lifeless beings in their eyes.

**Hitsumi:** We are talking about giants and orcs; can’t they overthrow a bunch of humans?

**Izumi:** Humans in Dangai aren’t the same as the ones back on earth. We are blessed with angelic powers. They were meant to be a gift, but we even managed to make that into a way of discrimination based on how much of your blood was angelic and its purity. Anyone with less than 20% angelic blood, regardless of purity or if they had the blood of something other than human, angel, or elf, they were considered a hybrid and excommunicated to the outskirts.

**Hitsumi:** That's... horrifying. Even after being blessed with something divine, you could still get exiled just because you’re a hybrid. It's cruel. I can't even imagine what life must be like for them out there.

<p class="centered">Izumi sighs, and his hand loosens.</p>

**Izumi:** Well, at least that’s no longer the case, thanks to her.

**Hitsumi:** You mean…

**Izumi:** Yeah, her. She worked her ass off, and it paid off. She changed how everyone viewed each other. *smiles* We were even able to build a portal from all the main points of the outskirts to O-Ten.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* I see.

<p class="centered">Slowly, her smile turns into a frown, and she shouts at him</p>

**Hitsumi:** YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHY THIS PLACE IS NAMELESS.

**Izumi:** Oh yeah, my bad. (he says as he sticks his tongue out and rubs his hair). That brings me to the fifth part, the nameless. It lies outside the borders of the outskirts.

**Hitsumi:** Why is there a huge border around the outskirts? Can’t you just let the people expand?

**Izumi:** *he looks at her, confused* Oh yeah, there's still something about Dangai that you don’t know.

**Hitsumi:** Which is? *Folds her hands*

**Izumi:** Demons can invade Dangai in two ways, one is dungeons, which are present all around Dangai, except in O-Ten. That was considered too much of a risk.

**Hitsumi:** *groans* Of course it was.

**Izumi:** There is actually a good reason for that.

**Hitsumi:** Oh, which is it?

**Izumi:** Because O-Ten is home to the World tree.

**Hitsumi:** *Her eyes start to glow* Ooo, that sounds interesting. What is that?

**Izumi:** Later, for now, just know that it is really important that we protect it.

**Hitsumi:** Ok *sad face*.

**Izumi:** And raiding these dungeons is one of the best ways to get real experience fighting demons.

**Hitsumi:** Mmm.

**Izumi:** But dungeons are heavily guarded with complex mechanisms. So, it’s really hard to invade through them.

**Hitsumi:** So, what’s the other way?

**Izumi:** Invading from the nameless.

**Hitsumi:** Ohhh…

**Izumi:** This is possible as everything within the border is guarded by divine protection, so demons can’t open gates directly in Dangai.

**Hitsumi:** That makes sense.

**Izumi:** And also, Dangai is infinite.

**Hitsumi:** Oh. WHAT?!

**Izumi:** Yeah, the nameless extends forever.

**Hitsumi:** SO, WE ARE LOST IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

**Izumi:** Yes.

**Hitsumi:** HOW CAN YOU REMAIN SO CALM?

**Izumi:** Oh, there's also another thing.

**Hitsumi:** WHAT?!

**Izumi:** Yeah, Dangai is actually really unstable in nature generally, as its stability depends on the strength of the current King, who, if my guess is right, I know personally, and he is pretty strong, but still not enough to completely keep it stable. So, as a result, everything outside of the divine protection is constantly shifting through space-time.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, so you're telling me right now we’re in the middle of an infinite terrain, and on top of which the area around us is constantly changing.

**Izumi:** Yes.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi starts releasing steam from her ears and faints.</p>

<p class="centered">-----------------------After 10 minutes-----------------------</p>

**Izumi:** There’s also another thing.

**Hitsumi:** WHAT? JUST TELL ME EVERYTHING.

**Izumi:** I know where we have to go.

**Hitsumi:** Yeah, the outskirts, right?

**Izumi:** No, I mean direction.

**Hitsumi:** How?

**Izumi:** I share a… complex connection with Dangai. So, I always know where it is.

**Hitsumi:** Is that something everyone here has?

**Izumi:** Nope, just me.

**Hitsumi:** Why?

**Izumi:** That, I’ll tell you later.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs* whatever. That’s enough lore for now anyway. So, which direction do we go?

**Izumi:** *closes his eyes* There, that way.

**Hitsumi:** Alright, let’s go. *smiles widely*

<p class="centered">-----------------------After 3 hours-----------------------</p>

**Hitsumi:** Huh, how much, huh, longer *with her tongue hanging out in thirst*

**Izumi:** Soon.

**Hitsumi:** I thought you were fast.

**Izumi:** And I thought you were light.

**Hitsumi:** EXCUSE ME, WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

**Izumi:** *laughs* I’m joking, I’m joking.

**Hitsumi:** Well, it wasn’t funny.

**Izumi:** Why are you even tired? I’m the one carrying you.

**Hitsumi:** WHY? BECAUSE IT’S HOT.

**Izumi:** I mean, it’s not that hot.

**Hitsumi:** IT’S PROBABLY 45 DEGREES.

**Izumi:** I guess compared to Earth, it's pretty hot.

**Hitsumi:** You mean you find this normal?

**Izumi:** I mean, not exactly. Dangai’s weather is pretty erratic. But I'm just used to hotter.

**Hitsumi:** It gets hotter than this?!

**Izumi:** Not usually, but I'm used to these temperatures because of my time in hell.

**Hitsumi:** Oh…WHAT?

**Izumi:**?

**Hitsumi:** YOU’VE BEEN TO HELL?

**Izumi:** Well, yeah, a few times.

**Hitsumi:** Well, I'm not even surprised anymore. To be honest, you deserve to be there.

**Izumi:** *looks at her uninterested*

**Hitsumi:** What, that was funny.

**Izumi:** Yeah, sure.

**Hitsumi:** Mmph.

**Izumi:** Those dungeons I said earlier are essentially a part of hell; besides that, I’ve even …visited the devil a couple of times.

**Hitsumi:** *shocked*

**Izumi:** I thought you said you won’t get surprised anymore.

**Hitsumi:** HOW CAN I NOT WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

**Izumi:** *laughs*. I guess you’re right.

<p class="centered">He looks straight again but notices her looking at him.</p>

**Izumi:** What?

**Hitsumi:** What happened?

**Izumi:** When?

**Hitsumi:** WHEN YOU VISITED THE DEVIL.

**Izumi:** Oh, that. Well, nothing special.

**Hitsumi:** Visiting the Devil is not normal.

**Izumi:** Well, that’s a story for another time; in short, he hates me. But that’s fine, because I hate him as well. *smiles*

**Hitsumi:** Just who are you?

**Izumi:** You’ll figure it out as time goes on.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, how do you even know you’re going in the right direction?

**Izumi:** Because, as I told you, I know where Dangai is.

**Hitsumi:** But isn’t the area changing constantly? We could be running forever.

**Izumi:** *I* could possibly be running forever.

**Hitsumi:** Whatever, same thing.

**Izumi:** The change doesn’t affect me.

**Hitsumi:** What?

**Izumi:** Alterations in time and space don’t affect me.

**Hitsumi:** How does that even make sense?

**Izumi:** I'm on a plane above them.

**Hitsumi:** Is that true for everyone here?

**Izumi:** No, only a very, very few probably.

**Hitsumi:** Are you even human?

**Izumi:** Technically, yes.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs* So how long will it take for us to reach there?

**Izumi:** We will reach the outskirts in about 8 more hours.

**Hitsumi:** WHAT?!

**Izumi:** Chill, you won't even notice the time fly by.

**Hitsumi:** I already am…

**Izumi:** Hey, I could go faster ok, but your body won't be able to handle it.

**Hitsumi:** *breathes heavily*

**Izumi:** *smiles*.

<p class="centered">Suddenly his face goes serious as he feels someone about to attack them</p>

<p class="centered">Out of nowhere, a spear is thrown at them</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi dodges it right on time and comes to a stop</p>

**Hitsumi:** WHAT WAS THAT! I THOUGHT YOU SAID NO ONE EXISTS HERE.

**Izumi:** There isn’t supposed to be. Why would anyone wander out of Dangai this far?

**Hitsumi:** Whatever the reason, he’s trying to kill us, take him down.

**Izumi:** Wow, you’re an aggressive little one aren’t you?

**Hitsumi:** I'm a fan of staying alive.

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles and changes his focus towards where the spear came from.</p>

**Hitsumi:** WHAT ARE THOSE?

<p class="centered">He looks up in the sky and sees a group of soldiers on griffins.</p>

**Izumi:** *smirks* our ride home.
