# Chapter 3

<p class="centered">They exit the portal on the other side. It looks like they’re inside a tree, covered by black branches with blue leaves. And through each of the cracks (just big enough to put your hand through) you can see different places, each very different from the other. They look around as they walk into a huge room made of these branches. There, they see a man standing, looking out into a crack in the shape of a rectangle with the scenery constantly changing from a field to a village, a sea, a forest, a city, a silver and gold path, and a fiery terrain filled with magma as they talk. They walk towards him.</p>

**Aoi:** *claps his hands* Well, well, well. Look who decides to show up after nearly half an eon of inactivity for no reas-*turns around* WHO THE HECK IS THAT!

**Izumi:** Calm down, it’s not important.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi looks at Izumi with a pissed-off face</p>

**Aoi:** That doesn’t mean you can just-

**Hitsumi:** PUT ME DOWN.

**Aoi:** Hey, don’t interrupt me when I’m talking.

<p class="centered">She looks at him</p>

**Hitsumi:** SHUT UP!

**Aoi:** What? (confused)

**Izumi:** Scary, right? She has that effect when she’s pissed.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi snaps her fingers</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hey, look at me, I’m not done with you.

**Izumi:** What?

**Hitsumi:** *glares at him* Not important?

**Aoi:** Don’t take it personally, he's not the most affectionate person I know

**Hitsumi:** NO ONE ASKED YOU.

<p class="centered">She says in his face. Aoi backpedals</p>

**Aoi:** WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, WOMAN!

<p class="centered">He says with a confused look.</p>

**Hitsumi:** OH SO I’M CRAZY NOW.

**Izumi:** Not helping, bro.

**Aoi:** I DIDN’T EVEN SAY THAT.

**Hitsumi:** You know what, you’re right. I am crazy for trusting a random *friend* to travel across universes.

**Izumi:** Dimensions.

**Hitsumi:** WHATEVER.

<p class="centered">She storms off into a room</p>

**Izumi:** DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHERE YOU’RE GOING!

<p class="centered">He shouts across the chamber</p>

**Hitsumi:** I DIDN’T WHEN I CAME HERE EITHER.

**Izumi:** Damn, that’s a good point.

<p class="centered">He looks at Aoi.</p>

**Izumi:** Oh, I just realized, I didn’t even say hi yet.

<p class="centered">He goes in for a hug. Before he can get close, Aoi grabs him by the collar.</p>

**Aoi:** LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU FUCK UP EVERYTHING. GO M.I.A FOR NEARLY AN EON. NO CONTACT WHATSOEVER. AND THEN JUST DECIDE TO SHOW UP OUT OF NOWHERE. WITH A HUMAN NO LESS.

**Izumi:** Chill out.

<p class="centered">He goes silent for a second</p>

**Aoi:** Did you just tell me to chill out?

**Izumi:** Ehhh

**Aoi:** DON’T TELL ME TO “CHILL OUT”? ARE U AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOU’RE ACTIONS? THERE WERE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PLACING THEIR HOPES ON YOU, AND YOU JUST BAILED ON ALL OF US.

**Izumi:** OK, OK, I get that you’re a little mad, but let me explain-.

**Aoi:** A LITTLE MAD? MAD DOESN’T EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE HOW PISSED OFF I AM AT YOU. AND WIPE THAT SMILE OFF YOUR FACE.

<p class="centered">Izumi’s smile vanishes, and his tone becomes deeper. He keeps his hand on Aoi’s arm. And he lets go of his collar.</p>

**Izumi:** I’m sorry.

<p class="centered">Aoi’s face becomes loose.</p>

**Izumi:** I know what I did was wrong, but I had my reasons for it.

<p class="centered">Aoi notices the look on his face</p>

**Aoi:** It has to do with her, doesn’t it? We haven’t heard anything from her either.

<p class="centered">He looks down in defeat and clenches his fists</p>

**Aoi:** Is she?

<p class="centered">Izumi nods in silence</p>

**Aoi:** Well, whatever it was, I'm sure it wasn’t your fault.

**Izumi:** YOU DON’T KNOW THAT. YOU WEREN’T THERE.

**Aoi:** I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD’VE DONE EVERYTHING TO SAVE HER.

**Izumi:** WELL, CLEARLY I DIDN’T DO ENOUGH.

<p class="centered">The room goes silent.</p>

<p class="centered">He walks up to Izumi and puts an arm on his shoulder.</p>

**Aoi:** Izumi, I know that you loved her more than anyone, and I know you're stronger than anyone. If you couldn't save her, no one could have.

<p class="centered">A familiar voice whispers in his head.</p>

**???:** *We… could’ve saved her.*

**Izumi:** *(SHUT UP!)*

**Izumi:** *sighs* I'm sorry, that was my bad. I didn’t mean to get so into it.

**Aoi:** It's fine, I know it's not easy for you.

<p class="centered">There’s a moment of silence, then Aoi sniffs. He hugs Izumi and starts crying.</p>

**Aoi:** YOU KNOW HOW MUCH ALL OF US MISSED YOU.

**Izumi:** Hey.

**Aoi:** WE WERE LOST, WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.

<p class="centered">Izumi sighs and smiles, and puts his arm around him</p>

**Izumi:** It’s fine, I’m back.

<p class="centered">Aoi pauses</p>

**Aoi:** Wait, why did you come back?

**Izumi:** It’s a long story, but I have some things to do.

**Aoi:** So, it’s gonna be like the old times.

**Izumi:** Yes, like the old times.

**Aoi:** *grins* But wait, I just remembered.

<p class="centered">He pulls a letter out of his pocket and hands it over to Izumi</p>

**Izumi:** What is this?

**Aoi:** I guess you won’t be familiar with it.

**Izumi:** Oh, you can’t be serious.

**Aoi:** Yeah. Gabriel told me to give it to you the next time I saw you. He needs to see you and has told you to come to Silver City as soon as you get here.

**Izumi:** Of course, he did.

<p class="centered">He takes the letter and tears it.</p>

**Aoi:** *sighs* How many of those have you torn again?

**Izumi:** *smiles* I don’t know, I lost count.

**Aoi:** But you know u can’t go past the guardian angels without it.

**Izumi:** Wouldn’t be my first time doing so.

**Aoi:** *huffs* Suit yourself.

**Izumi:** Hmmm, I think I’m forgetting something.

**Aoi:** What about your human friend?

**Izumi:** OH, RIGHT. Thank you for reminding me.

**Aoi:** Quick, get her before she wanders off into the wrong gate.

**Izumi:** Don’t worry, I know where she went. I’ve been here so many times after all. You should know it too, this place is a part of you. After all.

**Aoi:** Yeah, it will be a good place for an apology for whatever you did.

**Izumi:** Yeah.

**Aoi:** And Izumi, that girl

<p class="centered">Izumi’s face becomes serious again</p>

**Aoi:** Is she...

**Izumi:** I don’t know.

**Aoi:** I thought she looked familiar. So, that’s why you brought her here.

**Izumi:** *nods*

**Aoi:** I won’t pester you for now, but you'd better tell me eventually.

**Izumi:** I promise.

**Aoi:** Okay, now go.

<p class="centered">Izumi turns around and walks to where Hitsumi ran off. He sees Hitsumi sitting at the edge of a cloud and looking at the scenery of a beautiful place. He goes and sits with her</p>

**Izumi:** It’s sick, right?

**Hitsumi:** ….

**Izumi:** Even though we’re not actually here, it feels just as real.

**Hitsumi:** Mmph.

<p class="centered">She turns her head to the other side</p>

**Izumi:** C’mon, it’s not that deep.

<p class="centered">He puts his hand around her shoulders, but she moves away</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs* I’m sorry.

**Hitsumi:** …..

**Izumi:** SAY SOMETHING.

<p class="centered">He forcefully shakes her shoulders</p>

**Izumi:** I’m sorry, ok

**Hitsumi:** Do you not respect me?

**Izumi:** What? Why?

**Hitsumi:** We’re supposed to be partners.

<p class="centered">His past memories interfere with his thoughts</p>

<p class="centered">A girl grabs him by his arm</p>

**???:** *smiles* After all, we’re partners right.

**Hitsumi:** IZUMI.

**Izumi:** *remains silent*

**Hitsumi:** SAY SOMETHING.

**Izumi:** This is pointless, come.

<p class="centered">He grabs her hand and begins walking towards the main room, but she pulls her hand out of his grasp</p>

**Hitsumi:** I’m not coming until you tell me.

<p class="centered">He sighs and sits down with her</p>

**Izumi:** I have a reason for not calling you that.

**Hitsumi:** And what could that possibly be? I trusted you and followed you to God knows where. So just tell me. Please.

**Izumi:** It’s a long story.

**Hitsumi:** What?

**Izumi:** The previous time I had a partner, it didn’t end well.

**Hitsumi:** Oh.

**Izumi:** It’s complicated, alright, that’s why I didn’t want to tell you.

**Hitsumi:** When was this?

**Izumi:** It was a long time ago.

**Hitsumi:** Like a few years.

**Izumi:** Uhh, try a few million.

**Hitsumi:** Oh… WHAT?

**Izumi:** Oh, right, I guess you never asked my age.

**Hitsumi:** I did.

**Izumi:** You sure?

<p class="centered">She thinks back and realizes.</p>

**Izumi:** You only asked if I'm older than you, to which I said yes. You’re the one who assumed it was by a year or two.

**Hitsumi:** Shut the fuck up.

**Izumi:** Ok. (looks down, sad)

**Hitsumi:** WHAT EVEN ARE YOU! (Now that I think about it, everything that has happened recently doesn’t make any sense)

**Izumi:** Well, technically, I’m a human.

**Hitsumi:** Well, technically, humans don’t live for millions of years. And they don’t fight demons either. Or know people capable of teleportation. Nothing here technically makes sense.

**Izumi:** Well, I get why you’re confused, but it will take way too long to give you a detailed summary, so I’ll give you a quick run-through.

**Hitsumi:** Alright.

**Izumi:** Listen well, first, you’re religious right, so you already believe in God.

**Hitsumi:** Yeah.

**Izumi:** That makes things a whole lot easier for me. God is real, and so are the devil, angels, demons, and all the other things that come along with them.

**Hitsumi:** Uh-huh. You don’t seem surprised.

**Hitsumi:** Cause I’m not, these are things I already know.

**Izumi:** Fine then, let me tell you something you don’t, how long has Earth and this universe essentially existed?

**Hitsumi:** Well, Biblically it’s about 6000 years.

**Izumi:** Yes, how long has heaven existed?

**Hitsumi:** Well, I’d guess as long as time has.

**Izumi:** Smart answer but not the right one, it’s close to hitting its one billionth anniversary.

**Hitsumi:** Really, I thought it would be older.

**Izumi:** And how old do you think God is?

**Hitsumi:** Same as time?

**Izumi:** No, he is older than time as he existed before time.

**Hitsumi:** Whoa, so he created time.

**Izumi:** Yes, how old is he exactly? Even I don’t know. Now the question I have for you is, with all that time between the beginning of time and the creation of Earth, do you really think he was sitting idly?

**Hitsumi:** I guess not.

**Izumi:** Well you guessed right, this universe isn’t the first one he created after heaven and hell.

**Hitsumi:** You mean to say…

**Izumi:** Yes, I’m one of the residents of the other universe he created in a sense. Humans believe there are three dimensions in total and I’m not talking geometrically. The universe you live in, Heaven and Hell. But there is one more of which there is no record in the human realm.

**Hitsumi:** So that’s where you’re from.

**Izumi:** Yes.

**Hitsumi:** What’s it called?

**Izumi:** *Dangai.*

**Hitsumi:** Dangai.

**Izumi:** Yup, that’s where I was born and raised.

**Hitsumi:** Wow, I have so many questions.

**Izumi:** I’m sure you do, but to answer them all would take another 3-hour episode, and I don’t think the audience would appreciate such a huge lore dump.

**Hitsumi:** Oh, I guess you’re right, but wait, you still haven’t told me why we can't be partners.

<p class="centered">His smile vanishes and looks down.</p>

**Izumi:** The last partner I had died.

**Hitsumi:** What happened?

**Izumi:** She got pulled into a fight that wasn’t hers.

**Hitsumi:** Oh, it’s ok you don’t have to tell me what happened next.

**Izumi:** No, I have to.

<p class="centered">she looks at him in silence</p>

**Izumi:** I couldn’t protect her, it was the first promise I couldn’t fulfill… I was supposed to have her back.

<p class="centered">He grinds his teeth and tightens his fist</p>

**Hitsumi:** I’m sure it wasn’t your fault.

**Izumi:** HOW DO YOU KNOW? SHE WAS RIGHT THERE, IN FRONT OF MY EYES AND I COULDN’T DO ANYTHING.

**Hitsumi:** …

**Izumi:** She died.

<p class="centered">Tears start running down his eyes.</p>

**Izumi:** She died right in front of me, and I was powerless. It was all because of me.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi hugs him</p>

**Hitsumi:** See, I don’t know much about all these things about demons and angels and whatever you are, but I know for sure you would’ve done everything in your power to protect her.

**Izumi:** And it wasn’t enough if only I was able to do it.

**Hitsumi:** Do what?

<p class="centered">He stands up silently and starts walking toward the chamber</p>

**Izumi:** It doesn’t matter.

<p class="centered">She stands up and catches his hand.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hey, I'm not really sure about, well anything really, but I trust you.

<p class="centered">He hugs her</p>

**Izumi:** Thank you.

**Hitsumi:** Thank me later, I’m hungry.

**Izumi:** *laughs* Alright come on let’s go.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, where are we going?

**Izumi:** Since when do you care?

**Hitsumi:** *glares at him*

**Izumi:** *laughs* ok ok, we are going to my home.

**Hitsumi:** You mean.

**Izumi:** *Dangai*.
