
**Izumi:** Get ready.

**Hitsumi:** Ready for whattt?

<p class="centered">Before she can finish, one of the guys dives toward them faster than Hitsumi can even register</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi jumps up towards the left of the griffin and dodges the spear, but as the soldier is about to pass by, he jumps again off the air and spin-kicks the guy off the griffin and catches it by its tail.</p>

**Hitsumi:** AAAAAAA

**Izumi:** Chill, I got this.

**Hitsumi:** WHAT? !

**Izumi:** Hold on tight.

**Hitsumi:** Why-?

<p class="centered">Before she can finish, he jumps up using its tail and mounts the griffin</p>

**Hitsumi:** AAAAAAAAAAAA

<p class="centered">She screams and hugs him tightly</p>

**Izumi:** Told you.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi catches her breath. He looks around and sees another guy coming towards him.</p>

**Izumi:** Get ready.

**Hitsumi:** Not again.

<p class="centered">He dodges the guy's spear by jumping up and lands on his spear. The guy pulls his spear back. He jumps up again. As he goes up a guy is ready with his spear. Coming at him from his left, he blocks the spear with his hands and grabs onto it, using which he yanks him off. He climbs onto this griffin now.</p>

**Hitsumi:** I think I'm feeling sick. *Nearly throwing up*.

**Izumi:** Just a few more, hold on.

<p class="centered">Two guys come at them from either side, he calmly waits till the last moment and slides back to the griffin’s tail and the two soldiers impale each other. A soldier ambushes them from behind with his spear pointed towards them. He lets go of the tail and falls towards his spear, he redirects it using his legs and kicks it out of his hand. He then kicks the guy off and lands on his griffin.</p>

**Hitsumi:** That’s it I'm getting off. *With a sick face*

<p class="centered">She gets off and stands on the griffin.</p>

**Izumi:** Don’t worry, that’s part of the plan.

<p class="centered">The only two soldiers left let go of their griffins and landed on his.</p>

**Izumi:** *To Hitsumi with a serious face* Stay back.

**Izumi:** *smiling* Hey there guys, I don’t know if you’ve realized it yet, but this isn’t meant to carry this many people.

<p class="centered">Without saying anything one of the soldiers attacks him. He plunges forward, Izumi dodges the spear and punches him in the stomach, sending him back.</p>

**Izumi:** Not one for small talk, huh?

<p class="centered">The other one jumps over his back and dives towards him. The other soldier attacks him from below. He tries to go back but bumps into Hitsumi</p>

**Izumi:** *Exhales*

<p class="centered">He blocks the soldier from below by grabbing his spear by the tip to buy more time. And before the guy's top can land, he moves forward toward the other soldier and backspin kicks him off the griffin. The guy from the top misses and impales the griffin, causing it to shake violently. Izumi and the remaining soldiers manage to hold on, but Hitsumi falls off without being able to balance herself. She manages to catch its leg and ends up suspended in the air.</p>

**Hitsumi:** IZUMIIII.

**Izumi:** Tsk.

<p class="centered">The guy runs towards him unarmed, as the spear gets stuck in the griffin. Izumi blocks all his punches and sends him flying off with a kick</p>

**Hitsumi:** IZUMIII!!!

**Izumi:** Hold on.

<p class="centered">He jumps down from the griffin and grabs her. She holds him tight</p>

**Izumi:** *grunts*

<p class="centered">He jumps off the griffin and lands on the sand, shielding Hitsumi from the impact.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Are you okay?

**Izumi:** *grunts* Yeah, I’m fine.

**Hitsumi:** *gasps* your hand.

<p class="centered">He looks at his hand, and the bandages around his palms are torn, and he is rapidly bleeding.</p>

<p class="centered">She tears off the bottom half of her t-shirt and ties his hand.</p>

**Izumi:** Chill, it’s not the deep-

**Hitsumi:** Shut up.

**Izumi:** *smiles*

**Hitsumi:** What’s with that face?

**Izumi:** Nothing *smiles*.

<p class="centered">She looks at him angrily and ties the last knot tightly</p>

**Izumi:** Ouch.

**Hitsumi:** Stop acting, after all of that, this is when you feel pain.

**Izumi:** *laughs*

**Hitsumi:** What? *flustered*

**Izumi:** Nothing. Now, how will you carry me?

**Izumi:** Come on, it’s not like I’m injured or anything.

**Hitsumi:** Then what do you call this?

**Izumi:** I’m used to it.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs* What are you?

**Izumi:** You’ll come to know soon enough. *smiles*, now let’s go.

**Hitsumi:** Go where?

**Izumi:** Look behind you.

<p class="centered">She turns around and sees a huge wall.</p>

**Hitsumi:** It’s so big, so this is?

**Izumi:** Yep, this is the border, cross this and we're at the outskirts.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, won’t it be guarded by more guards? Why did they even attack us?

**Izumi:** I don’t know. Most probably because they are ordered to kill anything on the outskirts without mercy.

**Hitsumi:** That makes sense. BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICER IF YOU LET ME KNOW BEFOREHAND.

**Izumi:** Well, now you know.

**Hitsumi:** That’s not how it works. Besides, how are you going to convince them to let us in?

**Izumi:** Convincing them we aren’t demons shouldn’t be too hard, the hard part will be to convince them to give us a pass to enter the capital.

**Hitsumi:** So you’re supposed to get a pass from the guards here, and then show it to the ones at the capital.

**Izumi:** How smart you are.

**Hitsumi:** But isn’t this kind of inefficient?

**Izumi:** It is, which is why it’s only done in extreme cases. People usually don’t arrive outside the border.

**Hitsumi:** What if they don’t?

**Izumi:** Then we will have to seek out alternate methods. *smirks*

**Hitsumi:** I like the sound of that *smirks*

<p class="centered">They look at each other mischievously</p>

**Hitsumi:** Besides, how did we arrive here?

**Izumi:** I planned it, of course.

**Hitsumi:** You mean you rode the griffin in this direction even when you were fighting?

**Izumi:** Of course.

**Hitsumi:** I guess you are a genius.

**Izumi:** Tell me something I don’t know.

**Hitsumi:** You’re also retarded.

**Izumi:** Ok, man.

**Hitsumi:** *laughs*

**Izumi:** *smiles*

**Hitsumi:** Wait, didn’t you say the area around us changes with time?

**Izumi:** It does.

**Hitsumi:** Then how did we arrive so soon? Did we get that lucky?

**Izumi:** It’s nearly impossible to get that lucky.

**Hitsumi:** Then how?

**Izumi:** Simple, it doesn’t affect me.

**Hitsumi:** HUH, you mean…

**Izumi:** Yeah, I negate alterations in space and time around me by nature.

**Hitsumi:** How does that even make sense?

**Izumi:** Don’t ask questions you don’t want to know the answers to. *Smiles*

**Hitsumi:** *sighs* Fine, so how do we enter? Is there a gate somewhere? A secret code?

**Izumi:** Nope, the good old way.

**Hitsumi:** *thinks*, *realizes* seriously?

**Izumi:** Hold on tight.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, wait, WAIT-

<p class="centered">He lifts her and jumps up nearly 100 meters in the sky as he reaches the peak of his jump. He slows down, plants his foot in the air, and jumps up again</p>

**Hitsumi:** *Closes eyes*

**Izumi:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">He reaches the top eventually and stands on top of the border</p>

**Hitsumi:** *breathes in and out deeply*

**Izumi:** Are you okay?

**Hitsumi:** I JUST WENT UP GOD KNOWS HOW MANY MILES; HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

**Izumi:** *laughs*

**Hitsumi:** Not *exhales* funny.

**Izumi:** What do you think of the view?

<p class="centered">She quiets down and looks to the side. She sees the small villages and cities, and far enough she can even see the green mountains separating them from the forest and the light blue sky above the clouds</p>

**Izumi:** Nice, right?

**Hitsumi:** Mmm.

**Izumi:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">As he looks down, his smile vanishes</p>

**Hitsumi:** What happened?

**Izumi:** There are no guards here.

**Hitsumi:** Yeah, why could that be?

**Izumi:** I can think of a bunch of reasons, and none of them are good.

<p class="centered">He lifts her and jumps down</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute-

<p class="centered">As he lands on the sand, it flies up and creates smoke all around him</p>

**Hitsumi:** *coughs*

**Izumi:** *looks around frantically*

**Hitsumi:** What are you doing?

**Izumi:** *ignores her* Anyone there? I’m about to make an illegal entryyy.

<p class="centered">He is responded to with silence</p>

**Hitsumi:** Look, I see someone.

**Izumi:** *sigh of relief* Hey, we need a special permit for entry.

<p class="centered">As he speaks, the guard doesn’t respond and walks toward them silently</p>

**Izumi:** We arrived in the nameless, don’t ask how? It's a long story.

<p class="centered">The guard continues to walk toward them in silence</p>

**Izumi:** If you can get me in contact with the king, I’m sure I can convince you.

<p class="centered">He comes in front of them and stops</p>

**Izumi:** Hello-

<p class="centered">Before he can finish, the guard attempts to cut his head off with his sword.</p>

**Izumi:** *backsteps* HEY, what was that for? We were talking.

<p class="centered">The guard looks up at him and Izumi realizes what he’s talking about isn’t human. He looks into the guard's eyes and realizes that he’s talking to a husk of what is human. He looked like he had his soul sucked out of him. He had no eyes, and his skin was shriveled to his flesh.</p>

**Hitsumi:** WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!

**Izumi:** I don’t know, but I can guess.

<p class="centered">He looks behind him, and hundreds of soldiers start walking toward them</p>

**Izumi:** I can also guess what is behind this.

<p class="centered">He looks up and sees something flying in the air.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Izumi, is that?

**Izumi:** Yeah, it’s a demon.

<p class="centered">The demon smiles at Izumi as he glares at it.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi’s face becomes serious</p>

<p class="centered">He launches himself toward the demon to attack it, but as he is going to land his kick, a husk jumps and blocks him. He turns around to punch it, and as his fist nears its stomach, it whispers something in his ear. Distraught, he backpedals and comes to the ground.</p>

**Izumi:** *exhales sharply*.

**Hitsumi:** What happened? Just kill those things. They’re not even human.

**Izumi:** *grits his teeth* (as he fights voices in his head)

<p class="centered">He jumps towards the demon floating in the air again to try to land a hit. Once again, a husk blocks his way, but instead of trying to move out of its way, he hides behind it, effectively removing himself from the demon's line of sight. The demon makes the husk fall to the ground, but is shocked to see that Izumi is not there anymore. He looks around and can’t find him. Before he can realize it, Izumi appears behind. He goes in to kick the demon's head off, but before his leg reaches, another husk comes in front of him, and blocks him. He stops, kicks himself back against the air, and lands on his feet.</p>

<p class="centered">The demon starts laughing.</p>

**Demon:** It's useless, even if I am blind, all of their senses are connected. As long as one of them sees you, all of them see you. This also, of course, means, even if you hurt one of them, all of them will feel the pain.

<p class="centered">The demon laughs, and Izumi remains silent.</p>

**Hitsumi:** What's going on?

**Izumi:** We need to run.

**Hitsumi:** Why can't you kill him?

**Izumi:** No.

**Hitsumi:** Wait, what-

<p class="centered">He quickly grabs her and starts running in a direction towards the outskirts.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hey, you’re going too fast.

**Izumi:** *remains silent*

**Hitsumi:** Those things are chasing us.

**Izumi:** *remains silent*

**Hitsumi:** How much longer before we reach the outskirts?

**Izumi:** *remains silent*

**Hitsumi:** HEY, ANSWER ME.

<p class="centered">Everything starts to blur out for Izumi, and the sounds start to become feeble. Suddenly, he is inside his consciousness. It's completely dark, yet it feels as if you can see everything. Behind him, a figure similar to him appears. Then he hears a voice.</p>

**???:** Answer her, Izumi.

**Izumi:** ….

**???:** What, you’re ignoring me too.

**Izumi:** Shut up. I don't need your help.

**???:** Are you sure? Do you really have it in you to kill them?

**Izumi:** If it gets to it, yes.

**???:** HA, don’t make me laugh. If you could, all those things would be dead right now, even more than they already are.

**Izumi:** ….

**???:** SAY SOMETHING.

**Izumi:** …

**???:** You won't, cause I’m right, and whether you like it or not, you know it.

**Izumi:** …

**???:** Face it, Izumi, you need me.

**Izumi:** I won’t let you have your way again.

**???:** And what, let her die? That would be kinda funny, She’s the one responsible for making you like this. Without her, you would’ve still thought logically. So in a way, she killed herself.

<p class="centered">The figure laughs hysterically</p>

**Izumi:** SHUT UP, NO ONE IS GONNA DIE.

**???:** Are you sure?

<p class="centered">Izumi’s eyes widen as he starts to realize his predicament</p>

**???:** Face it, Izumi, if you don’t accept my hand right now, the only thing you love will die, right in front of your eyes and you won't be able to do anything about it…..

<p class="centered">He whispers in his ear</p>

**???:** Just like before.

<p class="centered">Izumi starts having flashbacks.</p>

<p class="centered"><em>[Blurred Fragments]</em></p>

<p class="centered">He has multiple fragments of memories, ending with an image of a girl whose eyes are completely blurred out, with a smile on her face, she says “I love you, Izumi” as she dies.</p>

<p class="centered">His eyes widen in shock at the realization. Izumi stops running</p>

**Hitsumi:** What's wrong?

<p class="centered">The figure walks before him</p>

**???:** Come on, Izumi. It will be like the good old times. Just you and me.

<p class="centered">He reaches out to shake his hand.</p>

<p class="centered">Hitsumi keeps her ear next to his chest.</p>

**Hitsumi:** IZUMI, YOUR HEART’S NOT BEATING.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks at his hand as the figure looks at him with a grin pasted on his face from ear to ear.</p>

**Hitsumi:** IZUMI, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

<p class="centered">His veins start to turn black.</p>

<p class="centered">Finally, Izumi reaches out and shakes his hand in defeat.</p>

<p class="centered">The figure's smile widens</p>

<p class="centered">He drops Hitsumi on the ground.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Ow.

<p class="centered">The blackness of his veins starts to disappear as they move towards his eyes. As he opens his eyes, Hitsumi looks at him with a mix of feelings, shock, terror, amazement…. and fear.</p>

<p class="centered">The legion of husks stops in their tracks as the demon walks past them and faces Izumi.</p>

**Demon:** What happened? Finally accepting your fate.

<p class="centered">Izumi stands there silently</p>

**Demon:** Answer me.

<p class="centered">Izumi stands still, without showing any sign of fear</p>

**Demon:** That’s it.

<p class="centered">The demon takes a foot forward.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles...</p>

<p class="centered"><em>(Lucifer by Eminem)</em></p>

<p class="centered">As soon as his foot touches the floor, Izumi extends his Sakai, and the demon and all his husks fall to the ground.</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi starts laughing psychotically</p>

**???:** It’s so good to be,

<p class="centered">He turns around halfway and looks at the demon over his shoulder. His eyes are jet black, and his iris is shining gold.</p>

**???:** back.

<p class="centered"><em>To be continued...</em></p>
