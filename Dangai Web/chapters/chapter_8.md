
<p class="centered">The next day</p>

<p class="centered">Hitsumi slowly rises from the bed and yawns. She looks around and can’t seem to find Izumi. She walks down to the restaurant. She finds Reina serving customers and walks up to her</p>

**Hitsumi:** You guys open pretty soon, huh?

<p class="centered">She turns around, surprised.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Oh, sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you.

**Reina:** *smiles* No, it's fine, I just got caught off guard. It's not really that early, it's already 9.

**Hitsumi:** That is early.

**Reina:** *laughs* I guess.

**Hitsumi:** Where’s he?

**Reina:** (after a moment) Oh, Izumi, he's in the back.

**Hitsumi:** The back?

**Reina:** The kitchen.

**Hitsumi:** I didn’t know he was humble enough to clean vessels.

**Reina:** Oh, he's not cleaning, he's cooking.

**Hitsumi:** WHAT?

<p class="centered">She runs over to the kitchen. The aroma of sizzling meat and fresh spices filled the air. At the stove, Izumi stood wearing just his white tee with a focused face, wearing a chef’s hat, a pan in one hand, effortlessly flipping ingredients with a skill she wouldn’t’ve imagined him to have</p>

**Hitsumi:** *shocked* You know how to cook?

**Izumi:** *smirks* Of course I do, I'm a genius.

**Hitsumi:** *sighs*. Are you still wearing the bandage under that hat?

**Izumi:** No, it didn’t look good on me.

<p class="centered">She walks over to him. She notices that he is still wearing the cloth she used to cover his hand and smiles. He looks at her and takes a spoonful of the chicken broth. She shows her palm, and he pours a few drops on it. She tastes it, and Izumi waits for her response</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Oh my, this is actually really good.)*

**Izumi:** You’re not wearing your bandages?

<p class="centered">She looks at her arm</p>

**Hitsumi:** Yeah, the wound seems to have healed up.

**Izumi:** Mmm. So, how is it?

**Hitsumi:** Huh? (confused)

**Izumi:** The broth.

**Hitsumi:** Oh, uh, it's alright, I guess.

**Izumi:** Aw, really. (with a sad expression). I could’ve sworn I did everything right.

**Hitsumi:** *(Great, now I feel bad.)* I mean, if you add a bit more salt, it should be good.

<p class="centered">He looks at his broth in deep thought</p>

**Izumi:** Sure.

<p class="centered">He adds a bit of salt, mixes it and gives her a taste</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(It's still pretty good)* It's good now.

**Izumi:** Damn, how did I miss that.

**Hitsumi:** *(Shit, not the response I expected, now I feel worse)* It's fine, you’re only human.

<p class="centered">Reina walks in after some time.</p>

**Reina:** Wow, this smells good.

<p class="centered">He gives her a taste of the broth</p>

**Reina:** Mmmm, it's delicious. Just a tad bit extra salt, I think.

<p class="centered">Izumi instantly turns towards Hitsumi. She smiles, trying to escape her predicament. Reina looks confused</p>

**Reina:** Did I say something wrong?

**Izumi:** Noo, absolutely not. In fact, you couldn’t’ve been righter. It seems I was the one who was mistaken.

<p class="centered">He looks at Hitsumi</p>

**Hitsumi:** Alright, listen okay, maybe it was better the first time. But I only told you to add more salt in good faith.

**Izumi:** Really, and how is that?

<p class="centered">She scrambles to find words.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Uhhh, well, I thought you’d be happy if I said it was good.

**Izumi:** Uh-huh.

<p class="centered">He looks at her, waiting for her to say something</p>

**Hitsumi:** Fine, fine, I'm sorry. You’re a good chef.

**Izumi:** SEE, I told you I'm good. *smiles*

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* Yeah, you are.

<p class="centered">She turns around and walks towards the kitchen door</p>

**Hitsumi:** I'm gonna take a bath, quickly finish cooking, I'm bored.

**Izumi:** Gotchu.

**Reina:** I’ve left some of my clothes for you on your bed. And Izumi, I washed your jacket and kept it in the cupboard.

**Hitsumi:** Oh yeah, I remember seeing them, thank you.

**Izumi:** Thank you Reinaaa.

**Reina:** Also, Hitsumi.

<p class="centered">She turns around as she is walking off</p>

**Reina:** My clothes might be a little big for you. I hope you can manage.

**Izumi:** *chuckles under his breath*

<p class="centered">She looks at Izumi pissed off</p>

**Hitsumi:** SHUT UP.

<p class="centered">Looks back at Reina</p>

**Hitsumi:** Thank you, Reina.

**Reina:** No problem *smiles*

<p class="centered">She storms out and closes the door with force</p>

**Reina:** Did I say something wrong again?

**Izumi:** *smiles* No, she will be fine.

**Reina:** I’ll go anyways.

**Izumi:** *smiles as he tosses his pan* Suit yourself.

<p class="centered">She follows her out and catches up with Hitsumi</p>

**Reina:** Hey, I apologize if I offended you.

**Hitsumi:** *turns around, shocked* Oh, it's no big deal. *smiles* I was just exaggerating anyway.

**Reina:** *(I guess he was right)*

<p class="centered">After a moment of silence, Hitsumi asks a question</p>

**Hitsumi:** Reina, that police officer the other day. Are all of them like that?

**Reina:** *surprised*.

<p class="centered">She looks down with a frown.</p>

**Reina:** Yes, mostly.

**Hitsumi:** How come you can’t report them?

**Reina:** To whom? All of the officials are corrupt. We can’t even reach the royal capital.

**Hitsumi:** Thought so. By royal capital, you mean O-Ten?

**Reina:** Yes.

**Hitsumi:** Why can you not reach it?

**Reina:** How come you don’t know? *confused*

**Hitsumi:** *nervously* Oh, ummm. Because I have bad memory, remember, haha.

**Hitsumi:** *(FUCKING IZUMI)*

**Reina:** We are way too far away. We have to cross so many regions before we can get to O-Ten. It's just impossible.

**Hitsumi:** Oh.

**Hitsumi:** *(WHAT!)*

**Hitsumi:** Why did they want your money?

**Reina:** It's tax, we have to pay them 50% of everything we make. But I have to pay the few workers I have. To me, that is more important.

**Hitsumi:** That’s messed up. That guy, what was his name, Mizuki?

**Reina:** Michiro.

**Hitsumi:** Yeah, is he important?

**Reina:** He is the lieutenant of Gokurengumi Sector-G.

**Hitsumi:** Sector–G?

**Reina:** Yeah, the outskirts are divided into sectors from A to Z.

**Hitsumi:** *thinks*.

**Reina:** (raises her head again) I'm sorry, I'm taking too much of your time. Please continue with your bath.

**Hitsumi:** No problem. Thanks for sharing.

<p class="centered">On the way to her room, she sees a sign</p>

**Hitsumi:** “We are hiring, “Waiters/Waitresses”, Interesting.

<p class="centered">Some time passes, and she finishes taking a bath and comes out, drying her hair with a towel. She looks out the window and thinks about her situation for some time.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(Crazy life, huh, hard to believe I was a normal university girl a day ago, or however time flies here)*

<p class="centered">She hears shouting from downstairs.</p>

**Cook:** HEY, YOU’RE GONNA BURN IT.

**Izumi:** I DON’T KNOW HOW TO COOK VEGETARIAN, OKAY, WHO EVEN ORDERED IT?

**Cook:** JUST BECAUSE YOU DON’T LIKE VEGETARIAN DOESN’T MEAN YOU BURN THE KITCHEN DOWN.

<p class="centered">She smiles and chuckles to herself as she looks at the door</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(But I don’t mind it)*

<p class="centered">Suddenly, they hear an explosion from outside, and she instantly looks out the window. She sees smoke coming from a nearby building, down a few blocks. She quickly puts on Reina’s clothes and takes Izumi's black jacket, and runs down. She meets up with Izumi, who also abandoned his role of chef along with his hat and runs out of the kitchen.</p>

**Hitsumi:** What was that?

**Izumi:** Only one way to find out.

**Hitsumi:** Here.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi throws him his jacket, and he puts it on</p>

**Izumi:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">As they are about to run out, Reina calls out to Izumi.</p>

**Reina:** Izumi, I got what you asked me for earlier today. You might need it.

<p class="centered">She pulls out a wooden katana from under the counter and throws it at him. He raises his hand and catches it. He spends some time inspecting the blade and feeling the weight</p>

**Izumi:** *grins* Nice.

<p class="centered">He looks at Reina</p>

**Izumi:** *smiles* Thanks a lot, Reina.

**Reina:** *blushes and smiles* Mmm.

<p class="centered">Both of them take off in search of the source of the smoke. As they run out the doors close from the force of them opening.</p>

**Reina:** *exhales* *(I hope they come back safely)*

<p class="centered">Outside</p>

**Hitsumi:** I see the smoke, this way.

**Izumi:** Hey, hold up.

<p class="centered">He slowly catches up to her.</p>

**Izumi:** Why are you going so fast all of a sudden?

**Hitsumi:** You’re just going slow *grins excitedly*.

**Izumi:** I don’t like to travel at light speed all the time, nice to catch a breath of air sometimes.

**Hitsumi:** Uh-huh.

**Izumi:** *smiles* Why are you so excited?

**Hitsumi:** I don’t know. I usually spend all my time studying, so this is the most fun I’ve had in a long time.

**Izumi:** *smirks* We’re only just getting started.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">They reach the place of the smoke</p>

**Hitsumi:** It's that building. It's pretty big.

**Izumi:** *thinks* *(There's not too much fire, if anyone is inside, they shouldn’t be in too much trouble)*

<p class="centered">A piece of the building breaks and falls off.</p>

**Izumi:** *(Never mind. If the cause of the explosion was natural, then we should be good, but if it was induced…)* Stay here.

**Hitsumi:** What?

**Izumi:** I'm going in.

**Hitsumi:** Is it safe?

**Izumi:** Safer for me than a person already inside there.

**Hitsumi:** *smiles* Alright, don’t die.

**Izumi:** *smiles*

<p class="centered">He runs inside, without showing any trace like Sora.</p>

**Hitsumi:** *(That was the same technique Akihito used earlier. A silent flash, was it? I wish I could do it too.)*

<p class="centered">Inside the building</p>

<p class="centered">Izumi instantly covers the entire building</p>

**Izumi:** *(There's no one here; in fact, this building seems abandoned. There wasn’t any sign of construction, so it couldn’t have been a planned demolition. So, what could’ve been the reason for the explosion, or the source?)*

<p class="centered">He looks at a point on the wall parallel to the point of explosion and sees a point of impact.</p>

**Izumi:** Interesting.

<p class="centered">He looks around the fire and notices that he's been surrounded.</p>

**Izumi:** *smirks*

**Thug 1:** Would you look at that, we got a solo hero.

**Izumi:** *smirks* An ambush? What do you stand to achieve from this?

<p class="centered">He turns around and sees 6 people standing with weapons and fire protection artefacts.</p>

**Izumi:** *whistles* Fire protection, that’s quite advanced. For a bunch of thugs that is.

<p class="centered">They smile and walk towards him</p>

**Thug 2:** A fearless solo warrior, he is probably Inazuchi.

**Thug 3:** Not who we were paid for, but it works.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks confused and raises his hands innocently</p>

**Izumi:** Guys, I think you got the wrong guy. I’m not Ina-whatever.

**Thug 4:** You really think we’re gonna fall for that?

**Thug 5:** Hey bro, wait, Inazuchi doesn’t lie though.

**Thug 2:** Shut up, man, whoever it is, he has to be a member of the Gokurengumi, get him

<p class="centered">Izumi was now even more confused</p>

**Izumi:** Guys, wait, I'm not part of the Gokuren-

<p class="centered">Before he could finish, they all jumped toward him</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs*

<p class="centered">Outside</p>

<p class="centered">A crowd starts to form outside</p>

**Person 1:** Hey, what caused that huge fire?

**Person 2:** I don’t know, I heard an explosion.

**Person 3:** You know, a guy just ran in not too long ago.

**Person 4:** *shocked* WHAT? NO WAY.

**Person 5:** Probably a Gokurengumi squad member.

**Person 4:** IT HAS TO BE AKIHITO.

**Person 5:** No, it's probably Inazuchi.

**Person 6:** It could be Tsukihara as well.

**Person 3:** I don’t know, he didn’t seem like anyone I had seen before.

**Person 6:** Probably a recruit then.

**Person 5:** But why would they send a newbie alone?

**Person 6:** He probably went in against orders out of excitement.* smirks*. Typical mistake.

**Person 4:** Hey, don’t insult the Gokurengumi.

**Person 6:** Huh, what, you wanna fight?

**Person 4:** Maybe I wanna.

<p class="centered">Hitsumi stays back, witnessing everything happening around her, and sighs in disappointment.</p>

**Hitsumi:** Where is he? Why is it taking so long?

<p class="centered">A man points towards the building and shouts</p>

**Person 7:** HEY, LOOK, I SEE PEOPLE FIGHTING IN THERE.

**Hitsumi:** What?

<p class="centered">All six thugs are sent flying out of the building, through a closed window, breaking the glass. They land with a huge thud, and Izumi slowly drops down. A huge crowd forms around them and starts commenting</p>

**Person 3:** It is a recruit.

**Person 4:** YOU GOT THIS, MAN!

**Person 5:** How delusional could one be, to think they could beat a Gokurengumi member, so stupid,

<p class="centered">The six thugs stand up and try to fight him again</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs* You guys don’t learn your lesson, huh?

<p class="centered">Izumi goes to draw his sword, but then stops himself</p>

**Izumi:** Honestly, you guys aren’t worth it.

<p class="centered">He lifts his arms and enters a fighting stance. They all rush him one at a time, stupidly. The first one throws a left hook, and he dodges to the right; trips him with his leg and punches the second guy behind him in his stomach with his left hand. The third guy swings his axe down. Izumi stops it by holding the handle. He pulls it a bit to get him to hold on to it tighter, then uses the axe to pull himself towards him and punches him in his side. He looks up and sees the other three conjuring up a spell</p>

**Izumi:** Oh, so that’s how you guys did the explosion.

**Thug 2:** You’re done for shithead.

<p class="centered">Izumi smiles and vanishes. The thugs get startled. He appears behind them and puts his hand on one of their shoulders</p>

**Izumi:** But I have to say, three people for one spell is pretty pathetic.

<p class="centered">He inspects the circle from behind them</p>

**Izumi:** *(*smiles* as I expected)*

<p class="centered">He goes in front of them again</p>

**Izumi:** Let’s give the people a show, shall we?

<p class="centered">The thugs get pissed and shoot the explosive projectile towards him</p>

**Thug 1:** DIEEE!

<p class="centered">The projectile travels towards him, breaking the sound barrier, and only getting faster.</p>

**Izumi:** *smirks*

<p class="centered">He grabs the projectile, and before it explodes, he spins around to conserve its speed and throws it towards the air, and it explodes in the air. Everyone goes speechless, and the thugs go down on their knees in defeat. The crowd erupts into cheering</p>

**Izumi:** The impact on that wall was from when you guys blew up the building, right?

<p class="centered">They look at him, flabbergasted.</p>

**Izumi:** *sighs* Fine. I'll explain it. You guys made a mistake in the circle. That is why it takes some time after impact before exploding, and the force of the projectile also made an impact on the wall on the other side.

<p class="centered">He walks towards them.</p>

**Izumi:** Usually, advanced mages do that for various reasons. I’m guessing you copied it from a book. That’s why you should understand what you learn first. But since your angelic power is lesser.

<p class="centered">He stops in front of them as they fall on their back</p>

**Izumi:** You’re just too slow.*grins* To be honest, I was lucky to arrive this soon. Any later, and even that part would’ve broken off, and I wouldn’t have been able to figure it out.

**Thug 3:** You’re not a Gokurengumi, are you?

**Izumi:** That’s what I've been trying to say since the beginning.

**Thug 2:** Then just who are you?

<p class="centered">He looks back down at the Thug</p>

**Izumi:** *grins*I am-

<p class="centered">As he was about to finish, he was interrupted by someone</p>

**???:** Well, well, what’s going on here?

<p class="centered">A man walks up from behind as he punches his fist against his palm</p>

**???:** We thought something serious might be happening since this is pretty close to the border, but I guess it was just thugs.

<p class="centered">He sighs in disappointment</p>

**???:** We probably should’ve just sent a few recruits.

<p class="centered">The thugs look at him, and their eyes widen</p>

**Thug 3:** That’s him for sure.

**Thug 2:** Yeah, that’s Inazuchi. (Inazuchi Raiga)

**Raiga:** *grins* Did one of you say my name?

<p class="centered">Izumi turns towards him and smiles.</p>

**Izumi:** So you’re Inazuchi. I’m Kurosa-

<p class="centered">Before he could finish, Raiga jumped towards him and tried to punch him. Izumi manages to dodge and backpedal.</p>

**Izumi:** CAN I NOT FINISH MY SENTENCE ONCE TODAY?

**Raiga:** A thug like you doesn’t deserve to be known by me. (as he glares at him)

**Izumi:** Again, I'm telling you, this is another misunderstanding.

<p class="centered">He appears behind him and throws a right hook. Before it lands, Izumi turns around to his right and holds his hand with his left hand. Raiga gets mad and throws a left hook. Izumi lets go of his hand and jumps back to dodge it.</p>

**Raiga:** Stop running away like a coward.

**Izumi:** I am telling you, man, I'm not a thug, I don’t wanna fight.

**Raiga:** You think I will believe a lying scumbag like you.

**Izumi:** BROTHER, YOU’RE FIGHTING GHOSTS.

**Person 1:** Do you think we should tell him that he's not a thug?

**Person 2:** Nah, let them fight.

**Person 3:** Yeah, this could be interesting.

<p class="centered">The thugs look at each other and smile</p>

**Thug 2:** Boss, I think we should make a run for it.

**Thug 1:** Yeah, we can't fight him, he’s too strong.

<p class="centered">Izumi turns and looks at them furiously</p>

**Izumi:** Shut up. I'm not your boss.

<p class="centered">They hug each other in fear.</p>

**Raiga:** I knew it, you’re their boss.

<p class="centered">He turns back towards Raiga.</p>

**Izumi:** I swear man, this is just a huge misunderstanding.

**Raiga:** Shut up and fight me.

<p class="centered">Izumi looks down and sighs, then he looks back up at him</p>

**Izumi:** You want a fight. *smiles* Fine, you got one.

<p class="centered">Raiga smiles, then he rushes him. He throws a right punch, which Izumi deflects off, then he quickly throws a left punch, which he also deflects. Now that both his hands are away from his body, he kicks him in his abdomen. Right before the kick lands, Raiga barely manages to bring his arms back, forming a cross shape to lessen the impact. The impact gets sent back, but he manages to stay on his feet. Raiga looks at him angrily and quickly appears in front of him</p>

**Izumi:** *(fast)* *smiles*.

<p class="centered">He raises his hand to block a punch. Raiga throws a strong punch, which Izumi blocks at first. Then the impact lands, and Izumi gets caught off guard and gets sent back in a similar way</p>

**Raiga:** *smiles*

**Izumi:** *(Damn, he's pretty strong)*

<p class="centered">He looks at Hitsumi in the crowd, and she laughs at him insultingly. He gets pissed off and looks back at Raiga and takes a breath. He quickly goes right in front of him and punches him in the side</p>

**Raiga:** *grunts* Not strong enough-

<p class="centered">Before he could finish, he threw another punch, then another. After throwing a flurry of attacks, he does a back kick right in his stomach, sending him flying into the building, leading to it collapsing on him.</p>

**Izumi:** *exhales*.

<p class="centered">He then looks at Hitsumi and smiles arrogantly</p>

**Hitsumi:** Hmph *looks away*

<p class="centered">She looks at the smoke and notices something, and smiles. She turns back toward him and signals him to look at the smoke. Izumi looks, and his eyes widen as the guy walks out of the dust</p>

**Izumi:** *(seriously)*

**Raiga:** *smiles angrily* You’re pretty strong for a thug, I can’t lie,

<p class="centered">He cracks his neck and shoulders</p>

**Raiga:** What did you say your name was?

**Izumi:** Izumi.

**Raiga:** *(Interesting, I feel like I’ve heard that name somewhere before)* Very well, Izumi, you have earned the respect of Inazuchi Raiga.

<p class="centered">He reaches out and summons a weapon.</p>

**Raiga:** And to show my respect, *he pulls out a huge axe*, I shall put you to rest.

**Izumi:** *(seriously)*

<p class="centered">Raiga squats and gets ready to charge at him. Izumi puts up his guard and gets on his toes. Raiga lunges towards him with his axe. Izumi tries to dodge but only barely manages to, and ends up getting Hitsumi's cloth around his palm cut.</p>

**Izumi:** That was a close one.

**Raiga:** The next one won’t be.

**Izumi:** *(I guess I should finally use it)* *smiles* You’re right.

<p class="centered">He finally pulls out his katana from his waist.</p>

**Raiga:** I was wondering when you were gonna pull out your weapon

<p class="centered">He looks at his weapon and loses his smile</p>

**Raiga:** That sword, it's wooden? And it's not sharp.

<p class="centered">He becomes filled with rage, and a red aura surrounds him</p>

**Raiga:** I respect you by acknowledging you and using my weapon, and you pull out that toy. ARE YOU INSULTING ME!

<p class="centered">The sandstone beneath him starts to crack.</p>

**Izumi:** *smiles* We’ll see.

<p class="centered">He takes a Ko Gasumi stance (Google it), and a black aura surrounds him. Raiga shouts and gets ready to charge at him. Right at that time, a voice silences everyone and pauses the entire charade.</p>

**Sora:** STOP!

<p class="centered">Sora jumps in between them and looks at Raiga furiously</p>

<p class="centered"><em>To be continued...</em></p>
